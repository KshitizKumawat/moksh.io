      "Review after a month of usage, I felt inch loss within a week of using it, I am 157 cms and attached is bef and aft pics, I just had to loose around  4/5 kgs ,the last bit , which is difficult to loose (was 75 kg 3 years back). I dint workout, just calorie deficit with the shake, skipped any one of my meal with the shake , keeps you full for good 5/6 hours , I was bloated post taking it but not to an extent that it was uncomfortable, first day felt little nausea and dizzy as well after that it was fine , taste is very powdery I dint like the taste tbh. Basically it is a wonderful meal replacement drink but you can't solely rely on it for weight loss. I will order it again because it serves my purpose of avoiding binge eating in the night . It has  laxative property as well. I was not very regular in taking it , only when I had less time to cook and run for work, or no mood for dinner, so it's not addictive. you'll have to mix in a blender to get smooth consistency . Measuring scoop was provided . Served me for a month , not taking it regularly. So lost 1.5 kg without any effort in a month which is not bad.\n",
      "The product tastes good and working as advertised till now, noticing drop in my appetite. Overall, happy with the purchase\n",
      "Great meal replacement shake. Can be consumed by skipping the dinner.Good to have with milk as it becomes more delicious compared to water. You don't feel hungry at all till morning.Must buy if you want to lose some weight👍\n",

      "Very fruitful product. I suggest every one should try this ..\n",
      "It is helpful to maintain our body and daily facts. I have to eat outside food as I am doing a sales job in the local market. Now, this slim milkshake will take care of my body.\n",
      "It was sickeningly sweet and grainy. However, it was filling with a low calorie count. The ingredients of the blend are impressive.\n",
      "Mango flavor is best ,value for money product ,highly recommended slim shake in market.\n",
      "Amazing flavour!Very effective as I don't feel hungry after having this.It's a complete value for money product!Great quality\n",
      "The Coffee flavour is good but I didn't like the chocolate flavour much. Keeps me from getting hungry upto 4hrs max.\n",
      "Good product. Can give this product a  try. Flavor is also very good. it is a great value for money\n",
      "Test is awesome IAM replace 1 time meal in night. Nice product keep it up.and I reduce my 2 kg approximately with lightly exercise.\n",

      "Good\n",
      "I am writing this review after a week of purchasing Kapiva Slim Shake. I mostly use it in the morning at around 10-11 am. I loved the taste of it! They really know how to incorporate a healthy nutrient rich powder with good flavour. I usually have it with a banana mixed with milk in the shake itself as it makes the drink more heavy and also added some nuts with some chia seeds in it!Till now I can say that the drink is good and tasty but I needed to add extra contents in the shake to make it seem more heavy to go on for the rest of the day or to actually replace a meal; it might also have to do with the fact that appetite is bit bigger than normal intake that's why I felt this way. With time i'll make an update on that too! I don't think extra honey or sugar substitutes needed to be added as it has good enough amount of sweet taste to it and sticking to the normal scoop level is recommended but not extra.\n",
      "This slim shake can be described in a single word: \"unbelievable.\"I had previously used a few Kapiva products and had a positive experience, so I chose the Kapiva slim shake.The packaging is adequate, and a scoop is included in the container for easy measurement.I've been drinking it for a while now; it tastes great in both milk and coconut milk. After consuming 250ml of Shake, I was able to go the entire night without feeling hungry. After consuming it, I noticed some changes in my body weight. Overall, my experience has been satisfactory, and anyone looking for a promising slim shake can choose this one without reservation.Try it out and see how you like it.\n",
      "I am writing this review after 7 days of use, it's best product for weight management and i have used daily after workout and it give effectively results. Lastly I would say go for it!!\n",

Would recommend this product to those who are looking for a healthy nutritional meal without eating too much. This product is a must try.👍\n",
      "The claim of meal replacement is not right. The flavour is ok ok when takes with water.\n",
      "Awesome in taste yet healthy. Great product.Must buy👍👍\n",
      "Must try…It’s a complete meal replacement shake to skip the dinner and result will start effecting post 6-7 days consumption.Rich in coco flavour so no doubt in taste.\n",
      "This product shows its effect 100%... But my suggestion is that if someone is having stomach or intestine related problems like... Ulcer, pile's, fissure... Plz do not use it... It will create a big mess to u...I lost my weight all most 15 kgs in 3 months... Only by drinking it for 8 days... But as i was a patient of ulciritive colitis... I felt weakness alot....It defiantly works... But first you should consult ur doctor.\n",
      "Good product. Taste good.. Completely healthy.. Solubility could be a little issue requires a little extra shacking. But overall amazing product.\n",
      "Superb taste and rich in Coco flavour.Can be taken in both milk and water but I prefer to take in water. The good part is there is no formation of lumps at the time of mixing. Its super helpful to burn fat and improve body metabolism. After having this you wil never feel hungry and its great product to consume daily as meal replacement instead of regular dinner.Thanks to the Indian brand for making life simplier!!!\n",

      "Nice product from kapiva, but not that effective. Need to improve product ingredients and quality. The product is overpriced. Consider these points Kapiva product ans marketing team. As I am using your 7 products starting from superfood, tulsi ark, amla giloy juice etc. This slim shake isn't good. Thank you.\n",

      "Waste of money...no use\n",
      "The flavor /  is too bad. As if it is some sweetned powder drink. Baught by seeing good reviews but disappointed\n",
      "Worst taste, I mixed one scoop with water and blended it. It does not turn into a thick shake as advertised. It tastes horrible .like some watery sweet liquid. Did not give any results as well..I felt hungry even after having it.I am using chocolate flavor since last one week.\n",
      "It is not helping in weight loss.\n",
      "After so much of research I ordered this Kapiva Slim shake juice. Ingredients are very good and specially I like the flavour and taste of it. It's complete meal which can satisfy your hunger pangs for 3 to 4 hour. Go for it.\n",
      "Its working\n",
      "Feeling hungry even after having the drink.. cant use as substitute for meal\n",
      "Ok Ok kind of product. It feels powdery while drinking with milk. Seems like it does not mix well. Taste is like that of artificial chocolate and very sweet!\n",
      "The packaging and the taste are alright. it's a little grainy and it has a slightly bitter after taste.\n",
      "Good taste. The thickness depends on the quantity of powder added. Keeps the stomach full for a good 5-6 hrs. Yummy mango flavour. It tends to form lumps after adding milk. So should be stirred very well or a shaker can be used. Overall very good quality product.\n",
      "Very good product with excellent results\n",
      "I have been using Kapiva products since lockdown and trust me they are genuine and very well effective.I had to try this as soon as I saw this while browsing and I can say it’s definitely a must try for people who have gained the unwanted fats/wants to reduce the lockdown body weight in a healthy way, below are my findings:- I have literally started skipping my dinner thanks to this product (without feeling hungry)- pls use blender for a great taste and consistency- not sweet (it tastes like a healthy sweet and not access sweet)- 6 ayurvedic herbs, 12 super food and 25 vitamins and minerals- you definitely won’t feel hungry for good 5/6 hours after having this- it tastes yummIf you really want to take care of the excess body-weight in a healthy manner I strongly recommend this product💯% buy\n",
      "Don't purchase it guys.....\n",
      "This gluten-free shake saves up to 500 calories per serving, by replacing 1 to 2 meals. Sstain your weight loss journey with 6 proven Ayurvedic herbs. Contains more protein than carbs (and zero refined sugar), making protein the primary energy source. Proteins take longer to digest, so you feel full longerIt has that natural mango flavour making it absolutely tasty and is completely vegan too. The important thing is it’s richness in proteins, high in fibre and low in calories. Ain’t that sounding like a treat.\n",
      "Flavor is yummy - much like mango n thickness is apt n keeps me full for long.\n",
      "It's thick, yum & sucralose. I became hungry within an hour or so. I had craving for the mango flavour also for its awesome taste. May be they should reduce the sugar content and add in more fiber or something. Make sure you consume the powder with water as that will make it more vegan/ plant based. & we don't need to be always dependent on animals for everything.\n",
      "Kapiva helped me to loose 1 kg weight in just 15 days.taste good .It fulls you for 2hrs .and i can see improvement in my skin also .good product with good price.if you want to loose weight go for it☺️\n",
      "I m writing this review after using this product for 1 month. Flavor is ok, but this is worst product I have ever taken. It doesn't help anyway. It does NOT help with weight loss, nor it helps to body with providing any kind of vitamin, protein or WHATEVER features they have mentioned in the description and advertisement of the product. Please don't purchase.\n",
      "Everything\n",
      "Everything\n",
      "Purchased this after seeing the answers in the Q n A section, where i saw the company claimed it to be \"purely vegan\". But it is not! It contains whey protein which comes from milk. And when i asked about that they said they haven't claimed it as \"100% plant based\" which is true. But they've also said it's vegan in the questions section.Apart from that it tastes good. It does the job of keeping oneself full for quite a long time.\n",
      "I am using the mango flavor which is extremely artificial tasting to say the least. It is not as thick as compared to other popular brands such as Nestle. The thing that is most annoying is that it is very sweet and has a lingering aftertaste. I would rate it 3/5 as the product could have been much better! I'd suggest to go for Nestle Optifast as it is not sweet, thicker and definitely more satiating.\n",
      "Real bad taste. Has a cough syrup smell.\n",
      "I'm unhappy with the product because when I opened the packet , the seal of the box was already opened. And quantity was very less.\n",

      "This helps in shedding some extra fat with the help of little workout along with this slim shake...\n",
      "I bought this product last week (mango flavor). It tastes good, I take it with 200 ml milk, an apple, and 1 scoop of this meal replacement powder and blend it all together in a mixer and grind it until I get a thick shake. Almonds shall be chopped into small as topping. I found it healthy as it does contain protein, so many minerals, vitamins and 6 herbs specifically made to melt body fat. It works well when you consume it post workout. Anyhow please remember you take it as one time meal replacement, however a must mind the calories for the other two times of meal. I feel lighter after taking this. It works on skin complexion and hair growth too. About weight loss, cannot comment as its just a week I started to. Next time will order chocolate flavor. Worth of buying for one more time. Decent taste and decent package.\n",
      "All good but, The packaging has changed as per the images in product details, still I recieved an old design container.\n",

It keeps me full through the night and I don't feel hungry until the next morning. It tastes really good and I will definitely suggest you use this shake for weight control issues.\n",
      "Why this kind of rule for prime members price 1080 and normal members price 1300 so much difference this is not fair\n",

It tastes yummy and keep your tummy full for longer durations.One can have it as per convenience but I prepared it a replacement for dinner. It's been only one week since I started consumption but I could say that it makes me feel lighter. Looking forward to wonders it brings along in the coming future.\n",
      "Loved the packaging. They provide a scoop as well. Proper health drinkThe chocolate flavor is there but not too overwhelming. It is delicious enough to have a drink but not so chocolaty that you think of it as sugary. Which is good.\n",
      "Very good product the taste is very genuine not like a traditional chocolate flavor. Its highly recommended the quality of the packaging is also very good and upto the mark.\n",
      "Flavour is very nice and price is also reasonable. Although it has a little weird aftertaste but overall better than other slim shakes available\n",

      "I've been trying to lose weight since a long time. With the quarantine, and online work, it became worse and I users to feel more hungry due ti the mental exhaustion. Then I happened to come across Kapiva's Meal Replacement Slim Shake and I am amazed by it. First of all it comes in my favourite chocolate flavour that motivates me to drink and i am able to replace it with my meal one time in a day without feeling hungry. So yes I can see that it is working. It also has natural sweetness that makes it even delicious to consume. Just shake it a bit hard to make the powder dissolve.I would be buying it again once the current pack finishes. I would recommend it to all those who are seriously trying to shed off the extra fat bulging around.\n",
      "Have been using this product since few days and it is a great value for money. I have seen visible changes in my body. Not just for losing weight, I also feel strong because it has multiple nutrients added that usually we don't have in our meals.. without increasing weight, it has all the required vitamins and minerals and you don't feel hungry for good 5-6 hours after consuming this.This product is a must try for those are looking forward to reduce weight 👍\n",
      "Slim Shake is good in taste and smell, as the flavor of cocoa was easily identifiable. Most importantly, it is not too sweet which is good for people who will consume it regularly.It was soluble and didn't form any lumps while stir or shake. I have tried this with water as well as milk. But personally, I prefer to drink it with water as it helps to burn fat to reduce my weight and boost my metabolism.A really good product which will help people like me to achieve their fitness goals works as a complete meal replacement. Taste is perfect, can taste the raw cocoa mixed and the best part is there is no added sugar which helps to make drinks without adding sugar. Not too sweet or not less sweet the flavor is just perfect.Would recommend this product to those who are looking for a healthy nutritional meal without eating too much.\n",

      "A very healthy meal replacement shake. Tastes amazing and keeps you satiated for a very long duration. Must try if you're looking for a meal replacement shake.\n",
      "The product is a very good addition to your weight loss journey.The shake keeps you full for around 3-4 hours after consuming. However, it gives a bloated feeling right after having it, though it goes away in some time. Talking about taste, the chocolate flavour is just FAB. Not very sweet, it gives a proper chocolaty taste. The shake is very well soluble in both water and milk, but tastes better with milk. It also has a dietary texture due to the fibre in it, which is helpful for the body. Overall, a great ayurvedic option for losing weight.\n",
      "The packaging is very good and it's easy to make. So it can be consumed anywhere and anytime and take care of those hunger pangs.\n",
      "It is quite a good healthy shake with good amount of fiber content . If your appetite is less then it may be a good meal replacement as it contains every nutrient and its good to drink something healthy rather than eating unhealthy things\n",
      "I have been drinking this drink for a week and find it really helpful to cut down on my cravings. I take one scoop with water during evening hours which helps me to keep full. Unnecessary calories can be easily avoided.\n",
      "This slim shake is very tasty and filling. I look forward to trying out the mango flavour as well. I consume this with milk and it has a nice consistency. The only problem I had was the time it requires in the blender to mix properly. I have been using this post my workout meal and it has helped me with weight loss.\n",

Can't even keep me full for 2 Hours... I was not able to replace my dinner... After 2 hours i had to take my dinner lol... Tried even by replacing breakfast.. that too doesn't works... But i feel this product is helpful to replace my snacks.. also as a quick meal when i need to go out... This is my personal experience.... For every person the experience might be different.. anyway kapiva is worth trying out..\n",

And consume some light healthy snack and consume lots of water...... There a sample of other flavour also if you wanna try different taste\n",
      "I tried to overcome with my  rapidly increasing weight with regular dieting but got nothing. It reduced temporary 1-2kgs but i ws not satisfied with that. So i tried this KAPIVA SLIM SHAKE that i saw on Amazon. The thing that attracted me the most toward it was it was gluten and sugar free. It has __ flavours,u can pick according to your taste and choice. It is an Ayurveda based formula so it won't cause any side effects. It is a meal replacement drink so u can have it instead of your meal. Also it have proteins instead of carbs which will help u in a healthy weight loss journey\n",

      "I have received Kapiva Slim Shake, mango flavour a day before and have consumed just once but I must say it tastes really well and after having a glass of this shake I felt filled and didn't feel hungry for around 3 hours.Highlighting main points which I analysed in the product right from the delivery to its consumption.1. Tasty, not extremely sweet.2. I had it after my breakfast and then skipped my lunch because I didn't feel hungry as I mentioned above.3. I had mixed the powder gradually as it was getting mixed easily, didn't find lumps in the solution.4. When I received the product, it was in a loose Amazon poly, the delivery could have been done in a cardboard box.5. The quality of the seal of the box wasn't impressive.6. The powder tastes well both with milk and water.It was a surprise to find a sample of 25 gm chocolate flavour pack. It was good too.The above mentioned review regarding tastes and properties of the shake applies for both the flavours.I would recommend the product to be bought as it's really helpful if you're looking to reduce the weight. I bet you would be able to feel the result from the very first day!\n",

But I will definitely not rely on every other review here since most People are doing it for the cash back and maybe not yet used at the time of writing. Giving product 3 star for the ingredients, nothing very alarming in there, other brands have lot of unnecessary stuff mixed which isn’t safe, here no such problem and no sugar used. But protein content is very low in this product compared to the carbs which isn’t very practical.\n",

I used to drink my pro only in the after noon because i used to be out or used to be stuck up in work . Remaining time i maintained a calorie deficit diet to support fat loss with workout and cardio. Until today i havent experienced uneasiness or vomiting or any sort of stomach problems .People who are skeptical don't worry too much just go for it you'll never regret .\n",

I used to eat one apple once I feel hungry.This helped me loose around 2 kg's(shake plus an apple).You will get complementary bottle of capsule for hair, nail and skin growth.I have tried Haleshake meal replacement.I found this product better than that in controlling your hunger.I would say this is a better deal in 500 to 600 price range.Edit: After using for days, I started having loose motions whenever I consume it. From that day, I am not using it.\n",

      "I found hair in this jar and while making shake also I got an another hair. Very poor hygiene though it gives balanced nutrition. Please sort out the presence of hairs otherwise you will lose your market. On positive note, instead of mixing it in spoon and shaker, use mixie along with skimmed milk to make better consistency and to avoid powdery lumps and it works as stated. Taste is OK, so far I tasted only chocolate flavor and its similar to bournvita in all the ways. It works but speedy weight loss depends upon your body nature and the level of calories you burn per day as well. Other than hygiene, I am willing to buy it next time.\n",

Not too sweet or not less sweet the flavour is just perfect.Would recommend this product to those who are looking for a healthy nutritional meal without eating too much.Loved the taste at a pocket friendly price.\n",

It keeps you full for a long period of time and you can easily skip for meal for this.Inside the plastic container, you get individual refill packet and a plastic spoon. I wish we were given a shaker instead of the jar so that it would be easy to make and consume! I hope Saffola considers this as a feedback and implements it in future packaging.The BOGO offer is a steal deal too!\n",
      "I loved the flavour and its so refreshing. It has great benefits and protein intake. Highly recommended.\n",
      "I really liked the quality of this product, good results and great taste , recommended to everyone\n",

      "Dislike\n",
      "Before this I have tried other shakes. It’s good but I feel that after Sip it feels like medicine. Taste should be better.\n",
      "Good Taste, and as the name suggests, it's truly a meal replacement. The urge to eat anything goes off asa you consume it\n",
      "Nice flavor money ok thanks two time r one time informed ok Green tea also drink then weight loss ah\n",
      "Saffolo fittify gourmet hi protein slim meal shake is a waste product it can work in Wight loss and atleast inch loss also.this product is truly waste of money waste of time.i take 4 bottles no use of this product.i think herbal Life product is most better than thise product.\n",
      "Finally a flavour which u can drink easily without thinking....my search for meal replacement shake ends here with this flavour which is tasty, have a goodness of 50 gm protein, fibre and is affordable.\n",
      "The produce does meet it's labels. But I definitely don't recommend the mango flavor. It's so artificial and hard to drink. And you'll get constant burps of that artificial flavor\n",
      "One of the two containers had bulging sealed cover. It was suspected to be spoiled due to gas formation inside Its taste is also not good .Change requested many times but no action taken by amazon.Very unfortunate and poor service\n",

      "I just love its taste, was feeling very ligtg.i was not at all hungry after consume it. but after some more days I had cough in my chest due to large amount of milk daily consumed.\n",
      "I don't know why I m getting stomach upset, headache,though keeps me full, taste is ok but you have to drink only 200ml ,so it becomes a little thick and difficult to swallow..today is my 6th day of trying this product. And i lost 4kgs\n",

      "Bad prioduct am not satisfied\n",
      "This is first day to use। Realy liked this flavour। Very much tasty product।\n",
      "Please don't buy this product. Slim shakes and other slim supplements are fraud. I bought mango flavour. You can experience only the mango smell. But Taste is not good. Any way we bought is product for sliming. So taste is not important. As instructed i made shake with 2 scoops of this powder and 250ml of warm milk. The shake is some what thick and more or less taste less. After drinking this 250ml shake your appetite will not be suppressed. You wont feel filled up. Fake claims. Done good job with attractive packing. Don't get fooled by this product and waste your money. Instead many videos are available at youtube to prepare homemade meal replacement shake powder which are healthy and harmless. This fittify may contain harmful added flavours and other chemicals. And also very expensive.\n",

      "5* for Mango flavour, 1* for Pista - does't like Pista.Mango flavour is awesome but it will be great taste if you prepare it well.Here are the steps:-1. Take 250 ml Cow Milk in a milk juicer mixure jar.2. Add two full spoons of powder3. Add 50-60 mil of drinking water.4. Mix is well enough and drinkIf milk is chilled more .. it gives blend more making it real shake.I would suggest to take this shake in place of breakfast and dinner.Also have one chapati/Bhakari and sabjee in the lunch.Avoid tea/cofee with sugar.Do some excercise/walking for 30-45 mins for more quicker results -- its optional.\n",
      "One of the meal replacements that tastes so good and nicely supplemented with essential vitamins and minerals that would otherwise have been missed.\n",
      "Test improvement is required..... otherwise... nobody can purchase it second time....very bad experience regarding test of the product.\n",
      "Too many rave reviews..Can't figure out why..read the ingredients list,folks!..nothing so great and unique....Miniscule amounts of super foods like quinoa,buckwheat, moringa etc..Consuming whey protein daily has side-effects...Better to stick to small portion diet rather than falling for such fad diet gimmicks\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Good:-- Superb flavour, like a mango icecream-- Good nutritional value. You can have it as a protein supplement, or as a meal replacement shake.Con:-- Only con I see is lack of refill pack, why to buy plastic container everytime for continuous usage.\n",
      "Please stay away from such kind of marketing hoax and save your health and your money. This product which claims to be a healthy option for you is loaded with processed refined sugar (20% of net weight). All the super foods mentioned in bold doesn't even make up for 0.5% of actual weight of the product. The protein used is whey protein concentrate and not isolate so again not the best quality of the protein used. The total of amount protein per drink which comes to 19.5 grams is actually inclusive of the protein in skimmed milk as the actual protein will be just 14 grams. Additionally they are using refined vegetable oils. Adding fillers and thickners into a product and calling it healthy is pure play with the emotions of already suffering individuals and selling them at a price which is even costlier when compared to per gram price of premium whey protein isolate of various established brands. Some people will say but we've actually lost weight, this is because of the calories deficit and not because of this magic product. These guys are telling you to skip a regular meal which usually have around 500 calories and replace it with this shake which has around 200 calories. So automatically a deficit of 300 calories is created in a day and in 15 days around 3500 calories which will make you loose 1kg of body weight (I am using the word body weight and not fat because as long as you're not working out you're losing both muscles and fat, so if you want to loose just fat you've no other option but to do exercise of some kind on a daily basis to maintain the muscle quality).Please be aware about your health and don't rely on such gimmicks, even if you want to go on a calorie deficit as explained earlier go with whole grains and foods such as quinoa and oats (cooked in water) which will automatically make you feel fuller and are much more nutritious than these products.Lastly, I'll just say that these companies do not want to miss the tide and want to jump in for making profits by foaxing people to belive that they're there to help them, but people are ending up in a much worse situation. It's upto you to get informed and save yourself and your money.\n",
      "Caused low blood pressure problem to me not advisable\n",
      "I like everything about this product. Flavour and taste is amazing. I added 2 spoons with 300 ml normal water and whisked in blender. I got a thick shake. The Taste still remains in tastebuds for satisfied time. Highly satisfied at affordable price. Wish this buy one get one offer stay forever. 🤩 Happy satisfied\n",
      "Pros👍🏼 makes me feel full for a quite long time. Dont feel like eating anything inbetween.👍🏼 tastes better when mixed with cold milk.Cons👎🏽too strong mango flavour that it will be a difficult task to drink it on an empty stomach.👎🏽 the mango smell that comesup while burping is really gives an urge to throw up.It would be really good if the flavour is more subtle. The flavour is the only draw back of this drink\n",

      "Tests good. But it doesn't have everything they claim to have. After using it for months I am writting the review. To me it feels like just another milk powder with flavor and somewhat nutritional content. When it was not opened for some days it turned into solid rock like consistency, which usually happens with milk powder. Not worth buying. Although it might be an option for weight gain if taken with milk.\n",
      "Better than all other flavours of this brand saffola\n",
      "Tasty\n",

      "I was really excited to buy this product since it was a protein shake and also my fav flavor but omfg it tastes so bad that I puked! I can't stress this enough but oh god please don't buy this and it's not worth the money too cause the outer packaging looks really big but inside there just some packet with the powder and the worst part is I can't return thisok drink this with soy mill cause that has a better taste also not the regular one but with vanilla soy milk\n",
      "I ordered this and started using this as my lunch replacement. Initially when i saw dark spot particles in the powder, I thought it may only be the top layer. But later it seems, when we mix the powder with water, the dark particles seem to rise up on top. I tried filtering it out but to no use. I thought maybe its the water or my milk powder that i add to it, but when i clearly see the packet, it had dozens of black particles. I feel this product is highly adulterated. Buy and see for yourself.\n",
      "Best product in best price . Delivery on time best deals buy 1 get 1.Full of proteinJust a suggestion plz saffola also provide reffils\n",
      "The taste is very good , you will get a mango taste. Not very sweet. I am ordering it for the second  time and now reviewing it after a use of it As for the results on weight, it is too early to say, I have used it with toned milk (but you must try it with skimmed milk if available near you), and I did lost some weight but I am following a planned diet and activities. One thing is for sure that it aids in weight management because it will serve as a one time meal for you.\n",

      "Weird medicinal taste. I like meal replacements shakes as they are a convenient way to replace (not skip) one or two meal but for that they should taste good. Other brands I have tried in past had better taste, especially mango flavor. This one tastes really weird, a bit medicinal and a bit like rotton frootie drink. I had it once and I don't think I will be able to use these boxes.It could have been a value for money but unfortunately the taste has turned out to be a big disappointment.\n",

      "Totally worth it. After having it i realized that i am not hungry. I can easily miss any meal after having it. Delivery was also very fast. Will recommend everyone to try it.\n",
      "No complaints  about the product but only received one jar instead of two\n",
      "Keeps you full for 5 hours. Love the delicious Mango Flavour!!\n",
      "Juz started using this till now it is good n taste is good especially mango n pista flavours.neef check with the results .n then will share my experience\n",
      "I am a huge fan of the Fittify range from Saffola. This over here the meal replacement shake is my go to option for the evenings, especially the mango flavour is my favourite. Around 4-6 pm I feel super hungry at the office and earlier I used to settle for anything that was available. Vada-pav, chaat anything that's tasty. But I realized soon enough, they aren't good for me. I have started gymming now and in addition to eggs, I carry a bottle of this and have one serving of this instead evening to make sure that I get my daily dose of protein along with other essential nutrients. I feel nice and full till dinner now.\n",
      "So so..\n",
      "Too much fragrances......\n",
      "The taste and product seems good and yes results are there. One complain though the shaker you are giving is of bad quality and smells awful even after washing several times. I know its free i'll suggest check before giving or don't give at all.\n",
      "Really great taste of alpohonso mango. I have lost 1kg in 1 week without any starving or exercise. Unfortunate now when I want to buy again Alpohonso mango is unavailable. I had tried three flavors cookies and cream, coffee and caramel and alphonso mango. I like alphonso mango the best!\n",
      "The product is good indeed, it mixes quickly with milk and mango flavour is wonderful. I took it only once and did not feel hungry overnight so hope to loose some weight. If I reduce even 500 g i will buy it again. I feel i should be able to.Update 20Sep2022: this time I received product which does not have same texture and taste as earlier. Quality is gone, it tastes like chalk.\n",
      "Nice\n",
      "I started using fittify from 21/05/19. Today I'm posting review after using for 10 days, once a day switching dinner for the shake. I used mango flavour and I love the taste. I have lost 1.8 kg in 10 days. I have already ordered a second bottle, this time in chocolate flavour. It is a good value for money...love it...a big thumbs up.\n",
      "Beware most of the reviews are fake🤬\n",
      "Well I ordered it for my sister and she took it in the night. After few minutes i.e 1-2 mins only her lips swelled a bit and she said to have itching in throat, well it happened for 2 hours after that she felt better. So this product might be allergic to her or may be any ingredient.\n",
      "got it for a great price.  ordered 2 - one came with a good shaker, the other was a significantly thinner, poorer quality sipper without FITTIFY logo. Corruption at the warehouse??\n",
      "Tastes  very good\n",
      "I love the meal shake, I have been using it daily after my workout. It's made up of plant based superfoods which helps in the nutritional level and also fills the stomach fast..reducing the calorie intake. Completely satisfied with it\n",

      "This product is waste of money this is not perfect\n",
      "First Impressions only- Tastes good. Like protein with an aftertaste of whatever flavor you order- The plastic bottle is of average quality for the price paid.- keeps me full.*will reserve comments on weight loss and update in a month*Suggestions- Please allow option of buying Refill Foil pack instead of that tacky plastic bottle for the environmentally conscious.- Also please give us an option of buying without the sipper bottle. Same reason as above.*I am giving it one star less than perfect because I saw some reviewers with nice thick fittify shakers while many like me got the cheap plastic ones*\n",
      "It is very nice.i bought mango flavor.after driking it my stomach feels full.it has high proteins,iron rich content.i recommend best to use\n",

      "Received the product on time and in good packaging.This low calorie slim shake is helping me to loose weight. I liked alphonso flavour.

      "For the first time I tried this product and I’m happy with the results. It acts as a meal at the same time with nutritional value. Moreover it helped me to reduce and manage my weight\n",
      "Many brands often claim to provide the best option but it’s important to make sure that when researching a brand, they specify important attributes. This includes providing the amino acid content, stating that it’s all-natural, and checking the nutrition facts to make sure the calories and sugar is low, while the protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals are high. Saffola FITTIFY Gourmet Hi Protein Slim Meal-Shake is the perfect meal you need ... This can translate into a weight loss of 2kg a month. ... While the lower calorie intake lets you slim the right way, almost 19gm of whey and casein protein content let you stay healthy. When talking about the contents its based on natural- plant based superferfood. The mango flavor eliminates the thought that we are actually taking a dietary intake. I think by taking this meal replacement shake we actually cut out the calories and will addup the daily vitamin nutrition. Give it a go.\n",
      "Great taste, that too with 70 % less calories. Curated by chef Kunal Kapoor gives more trust. Saffola has always been a trusted brand. And this shake delievers same. Along with benefits of 5 plant based superfoods - quinoa, moringa, amaranth, buckwheat and turmeric.And a free shake bottle is cherry on top of the cake. Will be trying it regularly.\n",
      "This product is created by nutritionist and curated by celebrity chef Kunal Kapoor,for a slimmer fitter life. It has 5 plant based superfoods hence enriched with their goodness,alongwith vital vitamins and minerals and last but not the least amazing alphanso mango flavour... Helps in shaping the body along with mild exercise,containing 4.2g fiber n 19.2g protein... Happy to introduce it in my diet plan... A must for all looking forward to shaping n leading a healthy life.. 👍😊\n",
      "Perfect taste , high rich protein ,vitamins and minerals .Perfect combination of taste with health.\n",
      "Delicious real Alphonso mango taste .. had it with cold milk. . ... stayed full for almost 3 hours.Guess Kunal Kapoor has worked his magic.Will be trying other flavours too .\n",
      "Amazing taste. I have trried meal replacers before but have always had an issue with the taste. This on the contrary I can have twice a day and each serving keeps me full for a good 4 hours.\n",
      "I simply love it. Have been using for a week now and I have already lost weight. It's an awesome product. I recommend to people who want to have a quick wholesome meal or want to get onto the weight loss journey.\n",
      "Not a fan of how hi-protein shakes taste...but this one is amazing..reminds me of a real mango shake. Will repeat\n",
      "I’ve used slimfast for years, this exact flavor but in the cans. I got the bag and It doesn’t close. I can’t figure out how to get the ziplock to close, I’ve tried repositioning it and squeezing hard but it won’t close.It also tastes off for some reason. Like kinda sour? Idk if they changed the recipe or something since early 2022 but I really don’t like it. I hope I can get a refund and maybe try to find it in store, but I doubt it since I used food stamps. I just wanted to eat healthier and smaller portions.\n",
      "Ive always had decent results. The formula has now changed. This was the last $30 plus bucks i'll spend with these frauds.Terry BOKC\n",
      "Its slim fast enough said.\n",
      "I love this, I can pour into my old container. Just wished it was vanilla.\n",
      "This is great for a shake. I don't use water, I use almond milk and add  in some frozen fruit and make it a breakfast smoothie. It's really good and I quite enjoy eating it every morning. I'm on the weight loss journey and I've noticed a difference in my appetite since starting this two weeks ago.\n",
      "Huge package, soft-bag type, that contains more servings than any can-style package I have ever bought.  I will buy this size/format all the time from now on.  I use this Slim-Fast powder plus a spoonful of instant coffee as my morning drink, and I like this routine.  Flavor is good, not chalky (as some used to be in the early days of weight-management foods).\n",
      "This is my second purchased and the first one came with zip bag slider. I like the slider and very convenience during rush time.\n",
      "For a product that is supposed to help you lose weight to have sugar is just ironic. Im betting they add sugar so you become addicted. Remove the sugar then I might buy this product.\n",
      "Great replacement meal. I use almond milk and frozen fruit to make it thick and frosty.\n",
      "Unfortunately I didn’t see any results plus it makes me hungry more than before , very disappointed ☹️\n",
      "It didn't fill me up. I took it in the mornings an hour before work and i was hungry by the time I got to work. With a low calorie deficit diet I felt like I was wasting my calorie intake with this. I could've had a real meal instead\n",
      "This is much cheaper than my grocery store. Yummy\n",
      "Omg i was excited to find the LARGE canister. The price was great, not quite the chocolatey flavor i was expecting but i mix it wit instant coffee or strawberries for a chocolate covered strawberry flavor.\n",
      "Slim fast powder it’s a little difficult to stir in with a spoon but, if you pop it in your blender it mixes well.\n",
      "Great meal replacement whether dieting or not. I take this when I travel. Most nightly accommodations now offer small refrigerators for milk storage. If fridge is not available I bring powdered milk.\n",
      "The price was great and delivery was fast.\n",
      "I am in my 8th week of the slimfast diet and feeling great. I love this chocolate flavor, I surprisingly haven't gotten sick of it at all yet. I do find that it doesn't mix well unless you use a shaker cup though if you don't like the unmixed powder in your drink, I don't mind it myself. I like this new packaging as well, I feel like it seals better, is easier to store and is a better value.\n",
      "On time and as advertised.\n",
      "Easy to prep and the powder goes a long ways.\n",
      "I usually buy small containers of Slim Fast at my neighborhood store, but this large plastic bag of Slim Fast is a great bargain.  I plan to buy my Slim Fast from Amazon from now in.\n",
      "slim fast powder takes up only about 1/4 of bag.  need to use smaller bag, also found no scoop in bag.bag very hard to use.\n",
      "It is very easy to use, both milk and water can dissolve the powder. But the added suger is just too much for meal replacement.\n",
      "Not really a meal replacement if you're looking to curb your appetite. Everything else is ok from what was advertised as far as I can tell SO FAR.\n",
      "Dont like that its not a full bag but its still a good value for what you get for 20 bucks its got the flavor tho\n",
      "Shipping was fast, and the flavor is good! Takes some of the hunger away in the mid day, and prevents me from snacking. Would recommend!\n",
      "Arrived quickly. Tastes as great as the store bought product. It works. Very happy!\n",
      "This tastes good - however, there are *NOT* 52 servings as advertised. Using the measuring scoop they provide, there are about 40 servings in this package, so you are being lied to and cheated.\n",
      "Es de buena calidad\n",
      "Love it. Bummed it's out of stock.\n",
      "This is Craig’s steering meal it helps him steer to Aiden faster.\n",
      "The flavor is like coffee. I don't like that. But the rest it is good to lose weight. Easy to prepare, and it keeps you for long time. I don't want to mess with regular times so I eat my lunch around noon. But I don't eat my lunch even as much as i used too. Because, I am still full. No weakness. No sleepy. I am finishing my second can. I will continue buying.\n",
      "Large package but it doesn’t come with a measuring scoop like the containers\n",
      "Mixes very easily\n",
      "I enjoy a SlimFast shake in the morning for breakfast. It helps me get going in the morning and I don’t have that hunger feeling. It helps me to feel satisfied and helps keep the weight down. I recommend this as a meal replacement. The taste is excellent and the price is right.\n",
      "Great flavor and what I expected.\n",
      "I noticed after these Covid times of gym closures and inability to go outside. I’m fat and my clothes are not fitting as they once did. Not currently having the time to train at the gym. It’s time to cut calories and weight. I’m not buying a larger size. So far so good with moderate exercise I’m down an average of 2 lbs a week. I have a few goals to meet nothing crazy.\n",
      "I did some math to figure out how many of these larger bags I would need to achieve my weight loss goal. I just got the bags today, and I decided to count the portion sizes myself on one of them. There is a 53cc scoop included. With the air tapped out, and completely leveled, there is only 46 scoops in my bag, not 52. Yah I'm only missing 6 servings. Not that big of a deal I suppose, but I'm a little annoyed anyways.\n",
      "In all fairness I would like to defend Slim Fast's Original Meal Replacement regarding the  statement  how much protein it has per scoop...nowhere on the container does it say 10g of protein per scoop...if these who are complaining would read the back label...it states 10g of protein  with 8oz Fat Free Milk ...if you want more protein then add yogurt...if you want less calories then make the shake with water...there is no false advertising ....this also pertains to the Advance Slim Fast Meal Replacement .....read the labels before making  a slanderous remark\n",
      "Great value. I refill a Slimfast canister with it. Great value for the money\n",
      "I ordered/received my first can of SF on 07/27 ,lost 10 lbs since then in about 3 weeks.Just just ordered my second can of this great tasting meal replacement drink.-Follow the weight loss plan, eat sensibly during the week and drink plenty of water.-  Great product and my GF notices she has more energy throughout the day and not as hungry while @ work.-\n",
      "I came upon this drink several years ago when I was having dental surgery.  I was unable to eat solid foodexcept for soups and ice cream and they did not satisfy hunger.  A friend told me about this and I starteddrinking it in the mornings and found that I was satisfied, not hungary for several hours.Since then, I have had times when I was unable to eat solid food and I always depend on Slim Fast to get me through it and then I just plain like it!!!  I have never had a weight problem but have had digestive irregularity.  After consistently using Slim Fast for only 1 meal per day, my digestive problems have been eliminated.  I plan to always have a can of Slim Fast in my kitchen.\n",
      "I was very happy with the product but the delivery took 2 weeks so, I ptobably won't order it again.\n",
      "FYI I make\n",
      "I did not have a problem with the vanilla or strawberry flavors, but the chocolate flavor made me sick each of the 3 times I tried it. I should have returned that one.\n",
      "After several days of eating this I could not understand why I was feeling so sick(migraine, nausea, blurry vission). I should of checked the ingredient list first to find that it contains Aspertame which contains Phlenalalenine. After research I found that this ingredient can cause all my symptoms and far worse with extended use. Also, this ingredient has been proven to cause cancer in rats and I don't see why Slimfast would use this in their product. Please beware of the negative side effect of consuming aspartame. Some poeple are more sensitive to it than others, but it's dangerous for anyone to be consuming.\n",
      "Went from 264 to 215 in less than four months. Works even better if you exercise also.\n",
      "I’ve been using this to help me drop weight since it does make me feel full to the point I don’t want to eat anything else. I’ve gotten all flavors but this one always seems to be in stock compared to the other flavors. But I do like the other flavors more then this one but maybe it’s because I’m always getting this one.\n",
      "Like the size  and I don’t use it yet I hope it is good\n",
      "I use this Slim Fast almost like an instant breakfast, but it is now difficult to find in stores.  I am glad I found it available on Amazon and appreciate its automatic delivery.\n",
      "Although the flavor was good it came in a large foil bag with a zip loc closure, but this large bag was only half full. Very sneaky . Also, waste of space.\n",
      "I love this mixed with milk\n",
      "I love it, great value for money and very tasty. Haven’t even tried it with milk yet.\n",
      "Take note of the sizes of each flavor!\n",
      "Good value for your money, highly recommend.\n",
      "So if you plan to stir with a spoon it's not going to work. You should blend or put in a bottle and shake real good. It's been 4 days and I've already started losing weight. Keep in mind it's not magic, you do still need to exercise. I replace breakfast and lunch with this. Combined with a low carb low calorie diet. I can see a change already. Personally I feel like it also gives me energy after drinking this too idk if it's just me.\n",
      "It Tastes really good. Not chalky or gritty. 8oz of milk is barely anything but we'll see how it goes.\n",
      "Its got a nasty taste.Buy the chocolate milkshake flavor instead.I've been drinking slim fast for a few months now and have tried alot of their flavors and this in MY OPINION this is NASTY!!!\n",
      "I have drank the product twice and never will again. The product itself tastes good and I don’t know if it works for weight loss. Both times I drank it, about an hour later I had the worst stomach pains of my entire life. I’m talking crippling pain that almost sent me to the hospital. I hoped that pushing and getting it out would help, but this action made it worse. I almost threw up and passed out, I was laying on the cold bathroom tiles in tears. I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy, I do not think it is safe for human consumption. The reason I drank it a second time was to make sure it was the culprit and sure enough it was. Please do not purchase this product, it is ridiculously unsafe. I would rather be fat than consume this product ever again.\n",
      "I just bought the chocolate royal flavor to lose some weight before an upcoming trip. I was sooo worried about the taste because I've had meal replacement shakes before that taste absolutely gross. This was a delightful surprise! I mixed my with coconut milk and it was delicious.\n",
      "This works great to add with your protein for your smoothie.  Tastes good too.\n",
      "I love rich chocolate royal! Definitely helps you feel full and great taste too!\n",
      "The Important Information section still lists Cocoa as the 2nd ingredient (Oh, I wish!!!).  The 5th product image shows an image of the ingredients that you will receive: no cocoa and the 2nd ingredient is sunflower creamer, which describes the taste of it.  I haven't found any other brands that I like better, so this tastes somewhat chocolatey if each glass is blended with a tablespoon of baking cocoa and at least a teaspoon of decaf instant coffee.\n",
      "I freeze a tray of nonfat Milk, put half of the tray into my blender, add no fat Milk to the line, add two scoops of Slim Fast, and it makes an AWESOME Milkshake, cures my hunger pangs all day long! Love this stuff. I have lost 15 lbs already, and that's in a Month!\n",
      "Use this product as a meal or as a snack.  Really like the flavor when prepared in a blender with milk and ice.\n",
      "Can will rust on bottom if you leave it on a wet surface. Ring on my counter is not coming off so good. Other than that very much like hot chocolate but nutrition is added.\n",
      "It tasted like drinking a cup full of chocolate sugar\n",
      "Use a blender, otherwise too gritty. A blender bottle that you shake will not mix it well enough.\n",
      "This is a great deal and it's exactly what I wanted. I can't taste but my husband said it's good\n",
      "Although this is marketed as a \"diet\" aid, for all practical purposes one can use it as an equivalent to the bottled breakfast stuff that comes in plastic bottles.  Mix with milk (lofat or otherwise) and you will save money and plastic waste.  I cannot taste the difference between Slimfast with milk and any of the prepackaged stuff, including Ensure.  The vitamin supplementation is comparable, and I cannot find any \"diet\" medication or additives in it.\n",
      "Great tasting unlike many other meal products I have tried.\n",
      "I started getting the already made Slim Fast in a bottle,  it was getting pretty pricey so I started to use the powder can. Even though you have to mix the powder with milk or yogurt for a smoothie,  it has been well with it.  I add Slimfast & shake up the milk in a covered shaker glass / shaker.  I have been bringing this to work.  I now keep a can at work with a gallon of milk in the fridge so I can make a shake for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I have lost about 5 lbs.\n",
      "Best flavor tasting shake around but it kept my blood sugar very high so I changed to the dialectic one which doesn’t help much with the blood sugar either\n",
      "Makes you gain weight, doesn’t help with anything besides give you extra calories.\n",
      "Product is good.\n",
      "The powder mix tast s whole lot better then the original ready to drink ones I can’t even drink the whole thing of the ready to drink ones so I’ve been useing this mixed one it tast and smell better\n",
      "The 1st ingredient in this product is sugar, so bad for you. I regret buying it. I should have looked at ingredients before buying this.\n",
      "No dislikes this is a big size bag so it will last awhile flavor is great classic chocolate quick easy to mix\n",
      "I’ve been using this product on and off for years, with good results. I don’t like the recent recipe change. It doesn’t seem to dissolve as easy now and has a more grainy texture. Flavor hasn’t changed too much that I’ve noticed. Please bring back the old formula!\n",
      "Have a closet full now don't need any more at this time. Thank you.\n",
      "This stuff tastes great and really helps you lose weight if you follow the program.\n",
      "I was skeptical about the shakes at first but I honestly can't wait to have them when i get up in the morning. I have it for breakfast and lunch and I like how i don't feel bloated anymore. I have lost 5lbs in about a week and i love it. Will be ordering more .\n",
      "Total mess. The bag was leaking powder then when I cut open bag the powder was everywhere and the container looked damaged. Not sure how this happened. Makes me wonder if it was packaged this way?\n",
      "Arrived in great condition!  I had no problems mixing it with cold fat free organic A&D milk with a spoon and no clumps.  And tastes great!\n",
      "I normally do not do this, but I am rating this a 5 star. I bought the Rich Chocolate Royal and I love the taste. I am hoping this would help me on my journey to a better healthy lifestyle. This taste so good that I am even considering drinking this even after reaching my goal!! I just enjoy it that much!\n",
      "I agree with most reviews shown on Amazon as this product makes a great drink.  We especially like it as a quick breakfast drink or use it to add to non fat milk making an ice cream milkshake.  But...  Here's the but part:  Still showing 31.18 oz. on the container, however my last 3 or 4 containers were about 3/4 filled.  Check out the photo I included. This latest can actually had a little more in it tan the 3 previous ones. Is this another example of corporate greed to save money but not mention it to customers?  Slim fast - Be honest with you very large customer base and change the information on the container to what's really in the can!\n",
      "THERE WERE BUGS IN THE BAG!!!!!I opened the bag to pour the contents into a storage container and there were decent sized bugs ALIVE in the powder!!! Ewwwwwwwwww!!!!!!\n",
      "I have been using this for some time, I watched a film \"The Sugar Film\" and when looking at lable for Slimfast which tastes great, is LOADED with sugars, this is the opposite of what you should use for trying to lose weight, OMG\n",
      "It smells amazing first of all, it’s a pretty big bag with a lot of room but the powder only fills about half which sucks. But overall it smells good, tastes good, and lasts. I use it for lunch since I need breakfast for my medicine\n",
      "The same slim fast flavor is there but it doesn't dissolve as easily as their powders in the smaller size cans.\n",
      "I really enjoy drinking this SlimFast Rich Chocolate Shake mix. I'm taking this as a supplement and not looking to slim or loose weight. The flavor is great, the consistency is good and overall satisfaction!\n",
      "Bought for a friend who loves it. Larger size is difficult to find and price point is better on Amazon 🦋\n",
      "I use for my daily breakfast.  I blend with an apple, a banana, cup of milk and ice for a delicious frozen shake.\n",
      "I am hypoglycemic and have a hard time eating breakfast. Eating so early tears my stomach up. I used this product every morning I put a small amount of hot water in a glass, add a scoop of instant coffee, then add my slimfast, mix well, add whole milk for extra carbs and protein, and finally pour over ice. It is a great way to add what I need in the morning without feeling bloated and miserable all morning. Keeps my blood sugar levels in check until I'm ready for my granola bar hours later. I love this product.\n",
      "I have been using Slim Fast Chocolate Royale powder for years. I don't use it as a weight loss product, rather as a convenient breakfast drink (and sometimes lunch). I ordered two 31.18 oz. cans of this stuff, only to find that something must have been added to make it very difficult to mix. If I vigorously shake, like I usually do, the mixture becomes very frothy and there are undissolved particles. If I mix it gently, I have to smoosh the undissolved product against the side of the shaker and then skim off the sludge from the top of the milk mixture, wasting product and milk. I had sent an email to Slim Fast and they reciprocated with coupons for free product. But what good is that is the product is the same? I even went to the store to buy a smaller size of the powder and it had the same result. Slim Fast - what have you added to your product to make it unusable?\n",
      "I gave me the runs .\n",
      "This stuff works great and taste amazing keeps you full great for people who keep eating at night but get ready to use the bathroom for a couple of minutes lol\n",
      "My doctor told me I had to lose weight, and I hate being hungry when I reduce my food intake. Slim-fast helps to cut the hunger. Also, the product arrives before the arrival date.\n",
      "It's great being able to get the larger size of this. Great value.\n",
      "The flavor was delicious surprisingly, I liked the  portion and thickness was very satisfying.\n",
      "Tastes great. I mix one scoop of this with one banana, a few ice cubes, a bit of milk or water and a spoonful of peanut butter (in my Ninja Fit) for a true meal replacement shake. Delicious.\n",
      "When Glambia bought Slimfast in 2018 they apparently changed the formula.  I have subscribed to it for years and am now getting monthly shipments that appear to switch randomly between the old and new versions.  I say \"appear\" because there is no explanation anywhere to be found.  There is a slight difference in the nutrition information, but the taste is the same.The most confusing thing is that the old version came with a 60 cc scoop in the can, but the new one has a 39 cc scoop.  The new version is a noticeably finer powder, so maybe it is equivalent, but, again, no explanation.Glambia just opened their own website to sell Slimfast, but it does not list this size, and their shipping cost is breathtaking.  Not sure what that means for the continued availability on Amazon.I would give it a higher rating, but the uncertainty means that one cannot be sure what will arrive when ordered.\n",
      "Like: I like the flavor. :-)Dislike: The dislike the price increase from 13.98 to 18.48 :-(\n",
      "This slim fast I am impressed with. The canister is much bigger than the ones you get from Walmart or Walgreens. So you literally get approximately half a can more. The taste is still very good. Creamy rich chocolate. Helps supplement my meals bc my chemo. It tells you how much to measure and the best part you can use water or milk. I use 1% I like the taste. Enjoy. 🥰\n",
      "Love the taste\n",
      "I have used slim fast for nearly 30 years.  I always froze it which tasted like chocolate ice cream. The texture is totally different and always taste icy. The tastes isn’t nearly as good.  The newest kind has little pieces in it that tastes like paper.  I hate to give it up but no longer enjoy it.  Why isn’t it smooth like it use to be and why is the chocolate flavor not close to real chocolate like it use to be?\n",
      "I don't know why, but buying this off of Amazon tastes terrible. I've bought Slimfast for years (it's a convenient quick breakfast) and I've never had a batch taste like this. Usually Slimfast is pretty tasty, but this is garbage. It doesn't even mix/dissolve properly. Grocery store products are perfectly fine, just don't buy it off Amazon. I have no idea how or why there's such a huge difference in quality between the same product from the grocery store vs Amazon, but there is.\n",
      "The product is fine-however the delivery person left the package sitting in the middle of my drive way as it was beginning to rain.\n",
      "Great value!!!\n",
      "great taste good product keeps you feeling full\n",
      "GOOD QUALITY GREAT PRICE ! mine is clean nothing is wrong when it arrived. Good size, and the price is GOOD !!! And delicious too please buy! Hopefully I’ll lose weight on this one I’m now 250lbs ! I’ll do my next review in couple of months !Herbal life is much more expensive and kinda similar taste kind of not alike !\n",
      "The headache is gives you and also being really thirsty.\n",
      "Ad expected\n",
      "The can was in horrible condition, deeply dented all over with scratches deep into the cardboard. I wouldn't even try it in case it was contaminated.\n",
      "Lost weight fast! Tastes great too! Drink 1 for breakfast and lunch and have a good dinner. I eat some fruit throughout the day and excersize 30 mins a day. The rest im sedentary.\n",
      "Its good. Tasty and definitely keeps the hunger away for a while. Havent lost any weight but I need to work on doing more than just this. Healing from an injury so hard to get moving again. Would buy again.\n",
      "Don't buy any other flavor of slim fast but this one.  Walmart is always running out of these when I grocery shop do I tried ordering it online thinking I'd be over paying for the small can but this can is huge compared to the Walmart one. Will order instead of picking it up from now on so I'm not drowning in tiny cans.\n",
      "the price is wonderful for the size of the product, thank you very much.\n",
      "I have this drink for lunch. I mix it with low calorie Almond milk. I throw a few ice cubes into the blender and it comes out like a shake.\n",
      "Mix in a banana and it is delicious. Been drinking it for years.\n",
      "Will keep buying, thank youu\n",
      "This is a straight forward product. I wo'n't give advice as to weight loss but I w ill just say that you can't just go to any store and get this can mix powder. Most carry premixed (probably better profit margin) and you DO need to take time to mix it. But the taste isn't bad (the chocolate) but don't expect it to be chocolate milk either. THat it isn't. For me, it helps curb craving which I am happy for.\n",
      "Years ago, the chocolate Slim Fast was okay, not crazy good...and I would be hungry again less than an hour later.  This Chocolate Royale flavor is excellent, and I notice that I do not get hungry again so soon.  At this point, I am not using it for weight reduction or maintenance, but simply as a meal replacement when I either don't have time to eat a real meal or I am not too hungry but want to keep my blood sugar level by having something nutritional instead of skipping a meal.  With the good fiber, protein, and vitamins/minerals, it is much better than just having a glass of chocolate milk.  I sometimes use whole milk, but usually either 1% or 2%, and I use a blender bottle that I got from Amazon, which makes it very frothy and milkshake-style consistency.  Even my husband enjoys it a lot.\n",
      "Great tasting! Love this powder.\n",
      "Still hoping to lose weight but at my age its very difficult\n",
      "like\n",
      "Gave me food poisoning. Guess that's one way to lose weight...\n",
      "To thick for me and I guess somethings ain’t for everyone\n",
      "This stuff taste alot better than it did when it first came about.even mixes better\n",
      "LOVE THIS STUFF.  IT'S MY GO TO SNACK AND BREAKFAST!\n",
      "It’s really good! I feel like it makes me go to the bathroom. It holds me over until lunch as well.\n",
      "I needed something to jumpstart my diet  and I find most of today's protein shakes taste like cardboard.  This throwback has less protein (10 grams) than most, but it tastes good and it satisfies.\n",
      "Tasty\n",
      "This did not keep me satisfied for four hours, maybe two tops. More a snack than a meal replacement in my opinion. I'm a female 37, weighing 149lbs. It did taste pretty good and better with milk than water.\n",
      "Use to make smoothies with this for a long time. Chocolate banana peanut butter smoothie. Tastes good. If your doing this to lose weight or for health make your own. Look at the mass amounts of ingredients. The one I make now cuts sugar, carbs, calories and tastes better.Almond unsweetened milkOverripe Bananas frozen or add ice.Unsweetened cocoa powderVanilla extractPeanut butterHoney if you need extra sweetenerThat’s all the ingredients as opposed to 100 different things in this one powder.Though like I said the powder does taste good so it’s up to the individual.\n",
      "Taste is good but it's just a bit too sweet.\n",
      "Although when I heard people say it would work I didn’t listen but they were right because even though it substitutes meals it doesn’t help with the fact mainly because it’s just chocolate milk with a little pinch of protein powder but in general I would just recommend eating health, cutting meal portions in half, and working out instead of waisting it on this.\n",
      "This is a good supplement instead of a breakfast\n",
      "I've been drinking this for years and have never grown tired of it.  Have a banana and a large glass of Chocolate Royale and you will be good to go.\n",
      "It solved our problem of breakfast! Like it\n",
      "My husband drinks this for lunch.  Has been for years.  Loves chocolate!\n",
      "Well, I know it seems like the title would sum up this product, but there's just so much more to slim fast than meets the eye. Add some instant coffee to this stuff and bickity bam, you got yourself some less flavorful yet healthier version of a frapp. Always use ice cubes, otherwise you're doing it wrong.\n",
      "I bought this because right in the front of the can it says 10g of protein in a serving. I've been using it for 3 days and the app I'm using to track my nutrition said it was only 2g. I thought it might be an app mistake so I grabbed the can and it's only 10g of protein if you add low-fat milk. I'm not a fan of milk and I don't drink it. Very disappointed.\n",
      "fixed my leaky radiator.\n",
      "Tastes great! My favorite shake!\n",
      "Great for breakfast and can't find this size in store\n",
      "No lid! What the crap. It's gonna immediately clump up in this humidity.\n",
      "This tastes like chocolate milk. It’s so good. A bit high on sugar and carbs for my taste, but I’m hoping it helps me snack less.\n",
      "Was very disappointed when Sam's stopped stocking this product at their stores..Seem to follow a pattern with Sam's.  They charge to walk in their doors but then think very little about customer satisfaction. I ordered 2 containers on-line (had to pay shipping now) to try out and the taste is not bad (it is different taste) but I have shared this with my granddaughter for the last couple of years who is Gluten intolerant and now the container does not say \"gluten free\" as it did before.  It also does not say \"34 shake servings\" anymore as it did.  Not sure what's going on but disappointed.  Seems that everything that works, gets changed or cancelled.\n",
      "Great taste and lots of vitamins makes this a great product.\n",
      "Taste good dissolves easy in nonfat milk and suppress appetite.Recommended\n",
      "Best price around!\n",
      "This product makes for a tasty meal or quick snack. Mixes easily and taste great!\n",
      "I got the chocolate because everyone seemed to really like it but it was nasty. Didn’t do much for me. It’s a good value for your money though\n",
      "I lost 2 pounds the last week. I'm replacing my dinner with this shake and doing exercises regularly. I think it is helping since I'm not having dinner and eating carbs. hahaIf I lose more weight I will edit this review for 5 stars.\n",
      "I'm still gonna wait another month to see if this product. I'm just not putting two stars because I'm still waiting to see results.\n",
      "I buy this every month. I drink it instead of eating breakfast and lunch. Keeps me on track.\n",
      "This tasted good but it didn’t help me loss any weight I face it had me gain weight.\n",
      "It tastes like chocolate milk! I'm using 2% milk.\n",
      "I just loooove slimfast! I love the rich chocolate royale flavor in particular and I like drinking it really cold! I find myself satisfied for at least a few hours and no cravings either. I just love it!\n",
      "I really, really wanted to write a good review because slim fast is so yummy but it was a really bad experience.  I did slim fast for almost 2 months as a meal replacement for breakfast and lunch.  It gave me such horrible diarrhea twice a day, I’m talking mud butt, in the bathroom for 20 plus minutes.  On top of that I started to develop bad headaches every day, the advice was to drink more water but I drink A LOT of water.  As soon as I decided to give up on Slim-fast the headaches and bathroom issues subsided. Really disappointed that it didn’t work out.\n",
      "It's like Nesquick chocolate milk which is both dangerous and great for those on a diet.\n",
      "- The product came in the package perfectly with out any problem- The delivery was fast- This is my 3rd time purchasing it and honestly  i am happy with it\n",
      "I’ve bought this before and love it. It taste amazing. Some days it fills me up but usually I get hungry for a snack early. I gave a poor review because the silver flavor/protection seal was not on the can I just received. Which makes me think something is wrong with it and not edible or used. Im so disappointed.\n",
      "It advertises 10g protein If you look on the Nutritional Facts it’s only 2g protein and only 10g if you mix it with non fat milk! False advertising. What if you mix it with water or something other than milk? They shouldn’t put that on the front of the can if that’s not accurate. I decided to go with Pure Protein powder that I found on amazon. Around the same price, 25g of protein and only 4g of sugar compared to the 11g with this product. Also around the same calories. Way better for your body.\n",
      "Love this, great chocolate taste.\n",
      "Decent for the money and the taste is good\n",
      "Repeat order\n",
      "The best mix for smoothie and diets\n",
      "It tastes great and all but even after cutting calories and exercising it doesnt help lose weight and it doesnt help with hunger at all.\n",
      "I’ve been taking this every morning for about 3 months.  I’ve gained probably 10 pounds since I started drinking this.  Yes, it curbs my appetite and I don’t need to eat for about 6 hours.  So why am I gaining weight?  I’m guessing all the sugar added.  Plus the sugar in milk doesn’t help.  I’m going to stop buying this.  I don’t want to gain another 10.\n",
      "This is a better deal then that big bottle that is only half way full.\n",
      "I don’t know what the other reviews are talking about where they are complaining about the taste, but my shake was DELICIOUS! I mixed it with unsweetened Almond milk and I’m beyond pleased with the result.\n",
      "Definitely works it tastes really good and I enjoy doing this daily.\n",
      "Love the flavor I lost 5 lbs so far\n",
      "I have been using it for a week, and have lost 6 pounds. I love it!!!\n",
      "Tastes great and makes me feel great.\n",
      "❤️❤️❤️\n",
      "For anyone who’s wondering about the 10g of protein, the powder alone isn’t. You get the 10g when mixed with 8 fl oz of fat free milk. I personally didn’t buy it for the protein part. I bought this solely to get my sweet fix. I mix this with 8 fl oz of coconut milk in a blender with a couple of ice cubes and man oh man it tastes pretty good. It sort of reminds me of ice cream. Can’t really complain for what it is. After all, it is slim fast =]\n",
      "I love the flavor.  A great substitute for a meal.\n",
      "Just wanted you to be aware before you order the larger can of Slimfast.  First of all I love the Rich Chocolate Royale. No complaints on the product.  Except that maybe it doesn't actually help you loose weight.  It just taste good and is a quick and delicious breakfast drink.  But be aware, the larger can (34 shakes/1.94 lb) is a rip off!  I didn't realize it until I had finished the can - WAY sooned than I thought I would.  I drink one shake a day so you do the math, it should have lasted 34 days, right? NO! Only 24 days. Do you know why?  Because they put a larger scoop (60 cc) in the 1.94 lb. can that they do in the 12.83 oz. can (39 cc).  I compared them.  SO you think you are getting more for your money but NOT!  See the pic.\n",
      "This is a great mix and very filling. I have lost over 20lbs since I started dieting 3 months ago. Sounds like awhile, but time really flies once you get into a routine with your calories. I have tried both the vanilla and rich chocolate, I use coconut milk if I am in the mood for something sweeter and then unsweetened almond milk if I want more of a creamy taste.\n",
      "Good price for this item\n",
      "Clumps of powder stuck together\n",
      "It says that there is a scoop inside and my container came with no scoop. So Disappointed. Wouldve given it a higher rating but that just made me disappointed.\n",
      "I'm not a big eater so I use SlimFast for meal replacement. I haven't really noticed any weight loss but my goal is not to lose weight. I just don't eat very much and I use SlimFast to replace one meal per day. I like the chocolate and peanut butter flavors and generally have them at supper time. If the flavor gets to be monotonous I just switch it up a bit using almond milk, coconut milk, heavy cream, banana powder, or even a spoonful of jelly.PROS- tasty- nutritous- easy to makeCons- none\n",
      "I love this product. I make 1 or 2 of these per day. I mix mine with ice, water and blend well. Very filling and taste like I am drinking a fudgesickle.\n",
      "There's a reason why Slimfast had been around so long. It works! The 321 plan is simple and easy to follow and the shakes are delicious. I was able to lose 50 lbs for my wedding and used it to maintain the loss afterwards. I'm now back on the plan fully to lose even more.\n",
      "Not chalky, tastes good and would definitely buy again.\n",
      "Good buy\n",
      "Excellent price! I've lost 49lbs over the past year by using this product. It really works!  Taste great!\n",
      "\n",
      "This product works like seen on tv. I  had used this product before and I can tell you this works to get the weight off.\n",
      "Great and quick shipping\n",
      "Hands down the best weight loss/management shake I have ever tasted (and I’ve tried quite a few). Slim Fast has made my journey to weight loss a lot easier, with this delicious shake.\n",
      "I know the first ingredient is sugar but I don’t care. Your brain needs sugar and if you drink this first thing in the morning you’ll burn it off by the afternoon. I drink it before I go on my walks and it replaces my one meal a day for me. It does suppress my appetite for about 5 or so hours until my next meal.\n",
      "Just what I wanted.\n",
      "The canisters of slim fast were packaged well, no issues. Thank you.\n",
      "As always, Slim fast is a wonderful meal supplement while loosing weight or just as a quick breakfast. It is rich and tasty. I would use again and plan to do so.\n",
      "Gritty unless you let it sit. I am though, seeing results even though I'm not crazy about the flavor.\n",
      "What can I say, it's chocolatey and delicious. Perfect for those who are in a hurry in the morning and want a quick breakfast.\n",
      "I use this with my coffee and it tastes good. I did have some stomach issues at first but after some time, my system got use it.\n",
      "Love these. The taste is great and I did loose weight. Easy to make..Recommend highly..\n",
      "Great tasting and it really helps me feel full.\n",
      "...I would have expected sucralose or stevia, NOT aspartame!\n",
      "The taste is excellent, now I want to see the wait come off🤔\n",
      "Great flavor. Taste just like chocolate milk.\n",
      "This product is great, and as someone who LOVES eating, I can say it really does fill you up. (Not as much as a pizza, but it will satiate your hunger physically.) I'll have one of these instead of breakfast/dinner.As with any protein shake or protein bar, you do have to get used to the \"chocolate\" taste as it isn't exactly like chocolate milk, but it's not difficult, and I still think it tastes pretty good! No complaints here.\n",
      "Got a big can last for awhile and the taste you can't beat it\n",
      "This is my second purchase, it’s my go to. I’ve gained about 30 pounds since getting a desk job and I used this to replace my dinner. I also ate healthier snacks in between meals instead of the usual chocolate and chips. I worked out on the weekend and at least once during the weekday. Dropped 5 pounds in two weeks!\n",
      "I saw that everyone else can came damage mines wasn’t and it was full it’s a nice size it should last me for awhile\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Surprisingly delicious and effective! I only have one shake a day to replace lunch and I’m already down 14lbs. ☺️ Yay! I should note I’m also on nutrisystem so it’s both that are working but on a taste basis I love it! Literally like chocolate milk.\n",
      "Came fast, tastes great with almond milk.\n",
      "Excellent\n",
      "Okay, usually when I first purchased Slim Fast, both the box and the seal was intact. But, now the box looked like someone was trying to open it. Also, the seal looked like it was about to burst. Yes, I did open the seal (it looked like it was about to pop, so I had to), so I'm not really sure what to do to it now. To be completely honest, I'm not really sure why this happened or what I did wrong to cause this.\n",
      "Definitely ordering another case!  So worth the money!\n",
      "Let me be clear, for $9.98, this product is phenomenal. I purchased about a month ago, late january for 9.98 as always, and I go to restock, and it’s $13.98 all of a sudden??? A 35% price increase out of nowhere??? What the heck... I’m really not sure it’s the best option out there for that price. It’s a great product but what’s up with that, if anyone knows why or if it can be bought elsewhere for 9.98, let me know...\n",
      "I had horrible headaches and stomach aches from this product unfortunately so I must stop drinking it. It taste amazing but it is an never going to buy again\n",
      "If you like the pre made slim fast you’ll love this. I think this is even better\n",
      "Very easy mix in, and it tastes great. Haven’t noticed a difference in my weight though\n",
      "Tastes OK I mix a banana with it. Lots of crushed ice.\n",
      "Seems good value and i like taste.  I prefer powder as i can make it stronger if i want.\n",
      "If you go online you can find how many calories a person your age, height and sex needs to sustain or lose weight.  This is the Best way I have found.  I've always had problems with overindulgence,  and have lost as much as 80lbs.  Currently I'm down 60lbs. I use slimfast as a suppressant snack. It is healthful and kills my appetite for awhile,  the best lo cal supplement I've found.  It has also helped immensely in times of illness when I couldn't eat anything.  Vitamins,  protein,  lo cal. Def reccomend!\n",
      "It's definitely better than their newer shakes which don't really mix in at all but it still leaves some small pieces in the shake. But it tastes good, I'll give it that.\n",
      "I'm 6'3\" 286 pounds when I started with this as a meal replacement for breakfast. I also have a smaller drink at night if I'm craving desert after dinner. I have lost 17 pounds after two months without changing the rest of the foods I eat. One drink in the morning will give me enough energy to last till lunch, were as before I had to eat a few hours after breakfast. It has really worked for me but I really like the taste which helps.\n",
      "I don’t use this to lose weight. I typically skip breakfast, but have been trying to at least get in a shake now. This stuffs awesome.\n",
      "I have bought slim fast for years but usually at the grocery store.  I was very disappointed in this can as it had no scoop inside the can as it usually does and it doesn’t say anywhere on the can how much to use, other than 1 scoop.  I tried 1/4 cup but it seems richer than normal.  Can someone help me with exact measurement since a scooper wasn’t included?  I dumped the whole can of powder out into two bowls thinking maybe it was buried in there, but there was none in there.  This will keep me from buying slim fast from Amazon again unless this is resolved somehow.\n",
      "The chocolate royale tastes just amazing. It actually fills me up for a couple of hours. First shake to ever does that. I just add fat free milk and a spoon of peanut butter powder and it tastes amazing. Great meal replacement. Tried the vanilla flavor but didn't like it as much as the chocolate.\n",
      "Loved it! Tasted great, curved hunger, and my want for sweets. Helped my bloating and overeating.\n",
      "Yummy\n",
      "Great value for the amount that you get\n",
      "As is misleading. Picture shows container with 34 servings but when when it arrives it’s only 14 servings. Needs to be corrected or you will be held liable for misleading consumers.\n",
      "I use more milk then advised cuz the flavor is very strong. It’s definitely filling. One scoop keeps me full for hours. It takes everything in me to eat a snack when lunch should be because honestly I’d be content not eating until dinner with this product. And I use this as my breakfast.\n",
      "Put this right back in the box as soon as we opened it. I have IBS and during a flare up live off of these shakes, so we thought buying from here would be more economical. I disregarded the bad reviews because there were a handful of positive ones. This smelt terrible, wasn't anywhere near the same color as normal slimfast, and tasted like chalk.\n",
      "The flavor is great and there's nothing better than the original.  This is hard to find at the big stores if at all.  Mix this with skim milk or powdered milk and you've got a great meal replacement that fill you up.\n",
      "Great original taste, excellent value for size.\n",
      "Love this flavor...delivered to my door it doesn't get easier than that. The price is amazing for this size can. I have it on auto ship.\n",
      "I accidently bought this. I thought it would be good for my low carb diet.  but there is so much sugar, its ridiculous!\n",
      "I love it because I got me 60 day worth for the price of 18 servings canister at the store\n",
      "Good product\n",
      "It’s a great product! I started this a week ago. I’m only giving it 4 stars because mine didn’t come with a scoop. Other than that it taste amazing! I bought the rich chocolate one. It taste like cocoa and has the consistency of a smoothie. It’s not too thick and not too watery. And I’ve already noticed a difference in my energy level and weight. Nothing extreme!! It’s only been a week. But yes I feel lighter, less bloated and more energy. I’m taking this along with a multi vitamin.\n",
      "Great taste!! Will be ordering again.\n",
      "Great!\n",
      "This powder makes super thick and creamy shakes.  Most weight loss powders are awful tasting but this one is great! Tastes good with milk, almond milk, soy milk or even water! Much cheaper to buy on amazon than in store.  They do not keep this size of the powder in any stores besides bulk shopping stores.\n",
      "Lost seven pounds with this.\n",
      "Whenever my daughter doesn't feel like making lunch she goes for a slimfast.  The flavor is good and is filling until she snacks later in the afternoon.\n",
      "Came fast and just in time for New Years. I’ve had this flavor before and love it. The cans are huge and will last me 68 days. 😍\n",
      "I drink it in my coffee in the morning Tate’s great\n",
      "Great for morning shake using it to lose weight\n",
      "Best price on a huge tube of it! So much cheaper than In store!\n",
      "good quality\n",
      "Excellent meal replacement shake.\n",
      "I have a slim fast milkshake every morning.  Add two scoops of cool whip and still can't believe how yummy and satisfying it is.  LUV, LUV, LUV this product!\n",
      "WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN\n",
      "Love this shake mix. It completely dissolved in milk and doesn’t make frothy foam. Does what it claims to do.\n",
      "Order arrived fast, great value (at the time best I found on-line), and taste great. Slim-fast shakes work for me, reached my ideal weight + since have been maintaining it with its daily shakes.\n",
      "Great product.\n",
      "This a great value for the price. It has saved me more than hundred dollars buying breakfast everyday at work. This has nice flavor, with almond milk or dairy milk.\n",
      "Wonderful taste! I drink it in Lew of dinner and have already lost  3 lbs in 2 weeks.\n",
      "Received quickly,. Tastes good.\n",
      "I have been using Slim Fast for the past few years.  It is almost the same thing as Ensure but tastes better (to me) and is less expensive.  Give it a try!\n",
      "As described on fast delivery. Will definitely reorder\n",
      "It’s slim fast. My husband uses it to loose wait and I use it as a meal supplement. Chocolate is the only flavor of Slim Fast that I will touch. I use my Nutra-Bullet and blend it with milk and ice. The ice is the most important part! A little ice helps by making the shake very cold, which I need. And the more ice, the the thicker the shake. A typical shake for me is 1 cup of ice, 1 scoop of slim fast and about 8oz to 10oz of milk. I just fill to the fill line on my bullet, but I assume it’s between 8-10oz. Enjoy!!!\n",
      "Good\n",
      "I add 4-5 ice cubes in the blender and that adds a little volume and dims the chocolate taste a little which can be a little strong for my taste.\n",
      "Taste great and low price\n",
      "easy to use\n",
      "Couldn't get computer to accept my new credit card\n",
      "One of our canisters was not sealed.  The shipping package is fine. But the canister is messed up.  See photos.\n",
      "mixed with fruit znd it still worked\n",
      "As advertised and tastes great. Plenty of protein and 3/4 scoop is all you need for one large smoothie.  Lost 35 lbs. so far !!\n",
      "All good\n",
      "Quality product at competitive price\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Excellent for weigh loss if you want to see fast results. I combined it with exercise and already lost 30 pounds in a couple of months!\n",
      "Something is definitely wrong with Slimfast powder now.  There are grains in it that wont dissolve.  At first I thought it was a fluke, ordered a new can - grainy.  Bought a can in the store - grainy.  These grains DO NOT DISSOLVE into the milk, whether using a blender or shaker bottle.  Don't know what they did but this new stuff is unusable.\n",
      "Looking for a  2 pk price again\n",
      "Cool\n",
      "Great tasting best shake yet.\n",
      "I ordered 4 of these and they were very chunky. They would not mix. I felt as if they were old or had been sitting in heat for a long period. The date was fine but I was very disappointed. I will order from Sams club from now on\n",
      "I had returned this product because I bought one from the store and received it anyway. (THANKS!) so I decided to give it a try and this is Day 3 on the shakes and all I can say is the 8oz portion makes me feel so full! I cant use a full scoop like recommended because it’s to chocolatey! It helps fight off my need to snack! Totally recommend because the rich chocolate flavor is the bomb!\n",
      "Very rich and creamy. Try with almond milk or cashew milk.\n",
      "I bought 6 large cans, cans were all dented and air must have gotten in , taste is terrible and powder is dark and moist. NEVER AGAIN is all I can say, every can was damaged\n",
      "I’ve been drinking Slim Fast Chocolate Royals for decades!  Love it!\n",
      "Great flavor\n",
      "Meh. Didn't lose any weight while drinking it, but it does work for those mornings when you can't find time to whip up a nutritious breakfast. Won't be purchasing again though! Congratulations to everyone who DID lose weight though 😉\n",
      "It was way too chocolate and gave me diarrhea. I drank it once and can't drink it again. Very sorry.\n",
      "This product is pretty delicious and does what it claims to do. Keeps my hunger at bay, i dont drink it twice a day though. Only once a day as a meal replacement . It helps with my weightliss journey but i have also been exercising and keeping my calories at bay. Stick with it . I have already lost 12 pounds .\n",
      "tried many different meal replacements, this one tasts the best. it doesn' have that nasty sintetic aftertaste. it actually tasts like chocolate shake. and it keeps hunger away for 3-4 hours easily\n",
      "This Rich Chocolate  shake is OK.  It is easy to make and shakes up well. (and doesn't leave a gritty or powdery residue).  With that said, the flavor is just OK - I've had better.  And the nutritional value isn't as good as other brands.\n",
      "Great Value for cost! Love the taste!\n",
      "Best tasting Meal replacement period.Chocolate royale tastes amazing,keeps you full for like 2-3 hrs.I am not sure about weight loss claims ,also not much protein as compared to other brands.\n",
      "As expected\n",
      "Tastes good\n",
      "Likes\n",
      "Was trying to chat with a rep, he or she completely stopped chatting with me and I waited 10 minutes and no one said nothing.\n",
      "Over the years I have purchased many different diet/supplement shakes. Slim Fast is what I started on years ago and that may have ruined me for expecting such great taste in meal replacement/supplement shakes. This flavor will always be my go to. Tastes just like chocolate milk!\n",
      "This is a more economical and environmentally conscious way to use Slimfast than the plastic bottles.  I prefer it now because I mix other things with the milk and Slimfast.\n",
      "I like the flavor and the thought that it will help me maintain my weight, but as far as it doing just that, I have yet to see it. It bloats me so my stomach seem bigger and causes gas. I'll probably still buy it as I like it for a healthier snack instead of a DQ shake.\n",
      "This product is lousy with sugar, the one thing they tell to avoid or reduce !!!\n",
      "Great big can and if you follow the plan you will loose weight!!!\n",
      "Love this shake! It’s great for breakfast\n",
      "Works for me as intended\n",
      "I first used Slim Fast in 2004 thinking that it was BS. It worked.Now that Amazon exists, I can give a detailed review of my latest experience with the Slim Fast shakes now.I started using the Slim Fast shakes at 223 pounds. After five days I was at 209 pounds. (Update: after another twenty days on Slim Fast, I'm now at exactly 200 pounds as of July 25, 2019.) I'll stop once I get back near 185 pounds.Buying the cannisters of powder is more economical than buying the already mixed bottles, but I have bottles for when I'm in a rush to get out the door (or when I'm just lazy that day, or just want a different flavor.)I usually mix four ounces of water with four ounces of milk in a measuring cup, pour the mixture into a tall glass, add the level plastic cup of Slim Fast (a little cup is included inside the cannister,) and stir it with a fork. I then drink it for breakfast, and then a few hours later for lunch. Slim Fast somehow curbs your cravings for sweets (though not completely.) Before starting work, I recommend eating a low calorie snack because, at the beginning of the diet, some days I would occasionally get a little hungry. I copy-pasted to my phone some 100 calorie snacks found online:100 Calorie Fruit Snacks1. Watermelon:2 ½ cups diced (350 grams): 100 calories and 25 grams sugar2. Strawberry:About 2 cups or 16 medium berries (294 grams): 100 calories and 14.3 grams sugar3. Cantaloupe:About half a medium melon (268 grams): 100 calories and 22 grams sugar4. Peach:1 ¾ peach (245 grams): 100 calories and 26.67 grams sugar5. Blackberry:About 1 ½ cups (232.3 grams): 100 calories and 11.3 grams sugar6. Pineapple:1 ⅓ cups of chunks (224 grams): 100 calories and 20 grams sugar7. Plum:About two small plums (215.7 grams): 100 calories and 22.8 grams sugar8. Orange:About 1 ¼ oranges (192.5 grams): 100 calories and 17.5 grams sugar9. Raspberry:About 1 ½ cups (190 grams): 100 calories and 7.8 grams sugar10.

      "I have been buying this product for years and this is the first time I have received a bad batch.  It is very dark and grainy and does not dissolve in milk.  I suspect it is a counterfeit.  The expiration date on the can is 11/24/2020 so I know it's not expired.  It is; however, too late to return it so I will just throw it out.  I would like to let the seller know that something is wrong with this product but I am unable to locate seller contact information.\n",
      "I absolutely love this flavor. It really tastes like you are indulging in a chocolate shake (if you blend it with ice). The price is also the cheapest I've found anywhere so that's a huge plus.As for weight loss, I've been following the Slim Fast diet for a week now and have lost 1.5 pounds. So this definitely works to get those extra pounds off!*Little update*It's been 3 weeks and I've lost 7 pounds!!!I will definitely be purchasing again!Highly recommend!\n",
      "Like the favor , like the large size ,\n",
      "Huge container of it. Cheaper than at the store. Love it!\n",
      "Great product, I use it for breakfast every morning. Tastes great!\n",
      "I typically use this every morning due to my busy schedule and it is the perfect substitute for those who eat no breakfast to a light breakfast.\n",
      "Yummy\n",
      "Good stuff\n",
      "For the price you can't get a better deal especially when much smaller containers cost more for less servings.\n",
      "I actually didn't use this for weight loss. (Though I have back when I was heavy, hence why I decided to use this in my situation, I knew I liked it, and it's filling) I was looking for a cheaper meal replacement because I was preparing for my full mouth extractions by having some of this ready since I knew I wouldn't want applesauce and mashed potatoes all day, wanted to just take care of hunger like this for the most part and since all I can eat is soft foods right now, this is perfect because I only ever want a little of a mashed food so until I get my dentures, this is a great substitute. Just wish they had the milk chocolate flavor in this size but I wanted a giant tub to last me until I healed and the taste is definitely rich chocolate so I just milk it up more. Going to try adding some vanilla flavor like people suggest next time but my personal taste buds don't effect my review. It's a good taste overall. Has WAY more nutrients then anything I've compared it to in regards to nutrition. Haven't felt weak despite not eating much and bleeding a ton from surgery. My daughter even liked the taste when she tried it.\n",
      "Great taste. easy to mix and take anywhere.\n",
      "It was okay.\n",
      "The flavor is awesome. I have been on my diet and tried a few and this is the best tasting by far. Curves your hunger 👍\n",
      "This stuff honestly tastes really good. I mix it will 2% milk (it says to use skim but...hard pass) it tastes a lot like nesquik chocolate milk tbh. If you have the self control to actually have this in replacement of two meals per day I’m sure it’d work great. Usually immediately after I drink this I want to eat a whole meal but I’ve found that if i force myself to wait 40min/1hr that urge subsides and I actually feel pretty full for a while. Resist the temptation y’all, it works!\n",
      "I was pleasantly surprised. Tasted good and kept me full for a good few hours. I just replace a meal with a shake and I’m good to go.\n",
      "I’ve been ordering this for awhile and haven’t had any problems but this last container was very granulated, not the soft texture it normally is.  I have to put it in my smoothie blender in order for it to mix properly.  I love the flavor of the chocolate but now I’m a little worried about what my next can will be like.\n",
      "🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟\n",
      "Great taste with portions that leave you feeling satisfied.\n",
      "Love this shake keeps me full and doesn’t have that awful after taste most meal replacements have\n",
      "This tastes good. But it did nothing for my hunger. I tried using it for breakfast, I even double scooped with double milk and nothing. It could be because I'm at the ends of breastfeeding but I wont know until I'm done with bc. I'll update.\n",
      "Absolutely great!!!! It really does curb your  appetite . I’ve lost 6 lbs so far in 2 weeks\n",
      "Great value.  I will buy again!!  Has greatly reduced my meal cost.  Mix with skim milk and your in heaven!!\n",
      "False advertising, says on the container 10 grams of protein but eight of that comes from skim milk if you choose to make it with skim milk. Mix only has two grams of protein and if you don't drink cow's milk like I do, it's not a good source of protein.\n",
      "Works great. If you have determination this will help out so much.\n",
      "Love the flavor!\n",
      "I have used this for years, and it's the best tasting liquid shake weight control product on the market.\n",
      "I remember this being big in the 90s when I was a kid. I figured I would try it out lol. This stuff works great! I mix it in with fruits & Veggies and make delicious shakes. SlimFast also had recipes on their site. It doesn’t keep me completely full for 4 hours I would say close to 3 hours. I also buy the pre mixed bottle ones. I have lost about 30 lbs doing 1 to 2 shake a day for meal replacement. That’s from December- April. ( 4months)\n",
      "When I told my friend that I was giving SlimFast a second go she told me the 90’s called and they want their drink back. All jokes aside, this makes a delicious meal replacement shake. I’ve used different brands in the past, like Vega and Shakeology, but man, they taste awful. I mix this with four ice cubes and Elmhurst Sweetened Almond Milk and it’s just such a tasty treat and only 260 calories. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a solid MRS. Love the rich chocolate.\n",
      "Its very tasty and actually makes me feel full. Would buy again.\n",
      "If you Really want/need to lose your weight.  Then follow the instructions and you will be smiling so hard.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Love this product! Taste great and it does work.\n",
      "This is not the original recipe.  I've been drinking slim fast for years and they must have changed the recipe. This will be going in the trash and I won't be buying anymore.\n",
      "I’m on a mostly liquid regime permanently due to oral surgery. I depended on ensure, boost, and other liquid supplements for my caloric intake. I came upon this product a couple of years ago, and it has as much nutritional value as those other brands, and keeps my diet balanced. Aside from the high quality of this product, the subscribe and save option for this item on amazon has saved me heaps money-wise, as it enables me to afford this product in bulk on a monthly basis. I’m so thankful for this slimfast powder and for this particular size, and it’s definitely affordable price.\n",
      "Good flavor and value\n",
      "I drink this 4-5 mornings a week, with 3 sliced fresh strawberries.I’m full, but not too full.I’m a repeat customer. 😎\n",
      "breakfast\n",
      "Great product\n",
      "I can’t say I’m losing weght yet, but that is more my fault. It has curbed my appetite some but not as much as I had hoped. Not a magic cure.\n",
      "Taste pretty good. Just lumpy whan mixed!\n",
      "Sometimes I don't have time to sit down for a full meal and have a tendency to go into a food coma. This i a great, quick energy booster and delivers a great nutrition profile and doesn't weight me down in the middle of the day when I don't want to sit down or take a nap. It tastes great and mixes well with other protein powders (strawberry, matcha, peanut butter, etc) when I want an extra protein boost for a workout. Great value. I can't find this price locally.\n",
      "i been tried few product..i found out this is the cheapest and the best taste (no more smell peas).\n",
      "Tastes great\n",
      "Ok\n",
      "This flavor is a bit richer than the original chocolate. I add a bit of espresso powder and coffee ice cubes. Good mocha flavor.\n",
      "I've been a SF-for-breakfast every day since 2015.  My local grocery stopped carrying the chocolate and I found a much better deal on Amazon and have been purchasing two cans at a time.  While it's not quite 34 servings, (perhaps it depends on how rounded you make the one scoopful), I am absolutely satisfied.  I don't even look for it at the grocery any more.  Tip:  it's yummy with a small banana and a handful of greens blended in--really accentuates the nutritional value--and don't forget a tsp. of cinnamon!\n",
      "Love this size which unless you pay money for a sams or cosco membership you cannot get, i will be ordering more in the future.\n",
      "Allows me to maintain weight loss in an easy manner during busy work week with an easy breakfast and lunch that I don’t have to think about.\n",
      "My wife and I have been using SlimFast for years.We have it for lunch instead of sandwiches.It is great for keeping the weight down and still getting the vitamins and minerals needed to keep healthy. Love it.\n",
      "It last long lol\n",
      "This item mixes completely. Some similar products that I have tried leaves clumps of products.  It have a great chocolate taste. I prefer the powder ready to drink ones.\n",
      "It helps with making me feel full longer\n",
      "Great size for the price even if you subscribe monthly! Love the flavor, does not taste super artificial! Blend with milk for a smoothie !\n",
      "Very yummy and kinda thick. I'm hoping this helps me lose weight while I recuperate from my broken ankle or at least keep me from gaining.\n",
      "Great!!! taste i like it help curb appetite.....will buy again  i also workout so i think i see some weigth coming off.... to be continued lol\n",
      "I've got these two 31 oz cans on subscription. I love the rich texture and fullness that I get with these. I mix it in my NutriBullet because I like to add some fresh ginger and either a half banana or some carrots. I've tried it with crushed ice and water and with crushed ice and non-fat dry milk. I like it better with the milk. My only wish is that they offered the vanilla and strawberry in this size. I'd like to have more variety.\n",
      "Just a great deal buying the larger sizer for a great price. Great taste, as a snack or a meal substitute.\n",
      "Helps me stay full\n",
      "Love this Slimfast product. It’s thicker than some others. Very good!!!\n",
      "Best tasting meal replacement I know! Has vitamins in it too. BUT it has a bit too much sugar in it. I don't feel very healthy when I have it but it's good and does the trick\n",
      "love it keeps my hunger at bay,i buy 2 a month an wish it came in larger quantity\n",
      "I love the taste of Slim Fast, it's a good breakfast replacement.  Keeps me satisfied until lunch time.  Get a delivery every 2 months which makes it so easy for me.\n",
      "I bought this because of the cost. I guess \"buyer beware\" applies here. There are 30g of cabs and 10g of protein!! Seriously!?! And that is with the milk.  Without milk there is only 2g of protein to 18g of carbs. The first ingredient listed is sugar!!! Yes, sugar!! Also it says gluten free and then warns there may be wheat in it. Since it will cost me more money to return it I will put it in the pantry and eventually it will make its way into the garbage! BTW this WAS one of the choices when I searched for protein shakes.\n",
      "Love the taste fills you up so you don't eat that much\n",
      "Bought for mother in law for meal replacements. She says the taste is really good especially compared to the whey protein. Unfortunately it’s not the healthiest because the first ingredient is sugar.\n",
      "I just received this and was excited to try it after reading all of the reviews. I will be replacing breakfast and dinner with these shakes and I was curious if it had a chalky taste or not. To my surprise this tastes great!!! I used almond milk and ice and blended it with my nutribullet. It almost reminds me of a frosty from wendy’s, lol. I also bought vanilla, but I don’t like it as much as the chocolate.\n",
      "Taste great even if you just use the instructions. Thank me later, for the first picture, best combo ever!\n",
      "Love the flavor! Tastes like chocolate milk. Sometimes I’ll add a banana and some ice to make a milkshake. The directions say you can mix with a spoon I believe, but I would definitely recommend mixing in a blender, otherwise you’ll have a ton of powdery chunks. It doesn’t control my hunger that awfully much, but they do recommend snacks in between meals so it makes sense. Definitely satisfies my craving for sweet things!\n",
      "On the front of the can it says 10g protein. However, the powder alone with water is only 2g protein. You only get 10g if you drink with a glass of low fat milk. The chocolate taste is okay. I had to do a scoop and a half for rich flavor. I wouldn’t purchase this again because it’s basically expensive fancy chocolate milk.\n",
      "Could not get some of this product to dissolve. Had to screen the last\"9\", 31.18 oz cans and had about 1/4 cup that would not dissolve from each can. Must be a hole in the process some where. This happened mabe 8-12 mos. ago and up till now. 3/06/2019\n",
      "Great. Definitely recommend!\n",
      "This flavor tastes just like a regular chocolate shake! Delicious and has all of the vitamins you need. Will continue to buy this flavor.\n",
      "Came in excellent condition.\n",
      "This product is tasty. It is most definitely better with milk than water, but water isn’t horrible. Oh and ice!!! I will buy again when I run out. So much cheaper than buying the bottles which I did for about 3 months.\n",
      "Taste great\n",
      "This is an amazing deal for a can this size! And it’s delicious. Will def be buying over and over!\n",
      "The can was open when arrived here all the powder fell in the box.\n",
      "Slimfast chocolate was TOO SWEET. It says 22grams sugar!! That’s too many. If I can return I will\n",
      "I lost weight\n",
      "Works great as a daily protein shake! It tastes really good and I have been using it mostly as a midnight snack. I can’t attest to its weight loss properties as I only use it for a protein snack.\n",
      "So, this item was sent to me in a box. And nothing was dinged when I took out my yummy SlimFast. The flavor when mixed with yummy milk was oh so delicious! If I weren't on a diet, I would have loved to sit right there and drink it all until it was all gone; that's how yummy it is. You might think I'm over exaggerating, but really.. I'm not. This stuff is just way too delicious to me.There have been reviews that mentioned that they didn't like the taste. Well, I say bah on that. Chocolate is yummy and this stuff is even yummier with milk.Now, onto the diet part. Yes, this stuff does help with my diet. I drink a serving of it and I'm not hungry for 2 hours. The container states 4 hours, but I can hear my stomach rumbling after 2 hours. However, after almost 2 months of this stuff, I imagine my stomach shrinking from not being a fat pig anymore. My tummy didn't rumble after 2 hours; but instead, it rumbled after 4.5 hours. So, this stuff DOES work.I say, try it out. It can't hurt.\n",
      "This is the same product I usually get but this time it seems different. It's darker in color, grainier and doesn't dissolve as well as previous batches. Its tastes ok but it's not as chocolatey as it is sweet. Nothing on the can says \"new\" so I'm not sure of the change. Plus it takes A MONTH to get this item. Good price but I think I might get it locally next time to see if its different. I've been using Slim Fast off and on for years so quit messing with it.\n",
      "To lose weight\n",
      "The product arrived and I was furious to see it contains only 2 grams of protein. I feel the marketing is blatantly misleading in repeatedly stating 10 grams of protein. The other 8 is from milk you have to add yourself; it's also strongly implied this product is ready-to-drink with water like the familiar cans. I looked at my husband's hot cocoa mix and it's literally the same amount of protein and calories; 2 grams protein and 100 calories. And at least the cocoa I could drink mixed with water! I am seeking a refund. This is not a nutritional product and I don't feel it would add any health or wellness benefits over just drinking a glass of plain milk.\n",
      "I have used this product for a few months with pleasing results but this last can I received was very clumpy and just will not mix thoroughly.  I've tried a shaker cup and a blender but the clumps are still there.  I order from amazon to get the larger size container but I am very disappointed with this order.\n",
      "Great product.  So handy\n",
      "Delicious!\n",
      "Great tasting and filling shake. Would buy again\n",
      "Love this product but your price has doubled\n",
      "this is the best tasting !\n",
      "I've bought this for years, and I bought 3 more of these and the last batch is much grainier and the texture of the powder is different. Enough so that my daughter thought I'd switched flavors of chocolate so I had to go back through my orders to see if it was the same one I've ordered for years and it was. Disappointed because this is my go to drink in the morning or I use it after workouts.\n",
      "Literally my favorite meal replacement. Try putting a scoop of the chocolate slim fast, 1 banana, ice, and almond milk (or regular low fat) in a blender and make a yummy chocolate banana smoothie!!\n",
      "Tastes like a chocolate milkshake. Add peanut butter for xtra flavor.\n",
      "This is false advertising- it is not healthy; tons of ingredients. It doesn’t taste good either. They also blocked my previous comment. They don’t want customers to know the truth.\n",
      "The flavor itself is really good but no matter how I mix it it stays very gritty compared to other slim fast mixes I have used. I mixed it in my blender cup, by hand, and even pulled out the full size blender. I probably won't be ordering this one again.\n",
      "Good Price Nice Taste!\n",
      "Wish Amazon would sell this again . They had the best deal. Love this flavor.\n",
      "On time delivery and exactly what I expected.\n",
      "It is good as usual\n",
      "It good\n",
      "Good stuff. I like it better than the high protein version.\n",
      "I make a smoothie with ice, non-fat milk, almond butter, peanut butter, flax seed meal, a banana, and the Slimfast. That holds me until about 1:00 when I have some nuts, and that is followed by an early dinner. I love the flavor and the nutrients contained in the Slimfast. I've been doing this for years, and my weight has been stable.\n",
      "Taste So Good O Drink It With Almond Milk Love It\n",
      "I love this product. Plain and simple. Now for a little detail, I don't like the suggested serving size, it's too thick! Directions say to use 1 scoop for 8 ounces of fortified fat free milk. It's just too thick for me. I also tried water and 2% milk and found 2% worked best for me. I finally worked it out to where I use 1 scoop per 16 ounces of 2% milk. Yes, a little higher in fat, but it works out about the same in total calorie count. I also let it mix for about 3 to 5 minutes before drinking. It makes sure it is as dissolved as it can get and far more drinkable.\n",
      "This is definitely not a good meal replacement. It kept me full for only 2 hours, and when I replaced lunch with this, I was just tired the entire day. The ingredient list is also full of things I don't recognize. I would rather go for Orgains as opposed to Slimfast.\n",
      "Its great\n",
      "ok\n",
      "good\n",
      "It tastes really good but it's basically chocolate milk. All the protein you're getting that will make you feel satisfied comes from the milk, so if you're using a milk substitute you're just having sugar. The ingredients are bad for you and it's not worth having those for the little good ones. I am very disappointed with it.\n",
      "My favorite Breakfast!\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "Love the tase and I will continue to drink it. I did not loose the weight but it’s for my breakfast.\n",
      "Love my Slim Fast\n",
      "Stuff is amazing. And delicious!!\n",
      "Is this a new formula? It tastes completely different 🤔. I don’t understand. I’ve been drinking slim fast for so many years and I couldn’t get enough of it. It used to taste so good.  This one tastes like I’m drinking a cup of sugar.  Tried looking it up on the internet to see if they changed the formula but couldn’t find anything.\n",
      "My wife and I have been drinking Slimfast for breakfast and lunch for over five years. We always order the same kind, Chocolate Royal. We have loved it for all these years and the taste was great. We usually order four cans at a time from Amazon.The last batch we got, YUCK. Absolutely disgusting. I am not sure what has happened but the change is obvious, the powder doesn't even look the same, its not as dark as the older stuff. I really feel like maybe we got counterfeit powder or something. I know that sounds crazy but the taste is so different and disgusting from a batch we just ordered a couple months ago, and all the other batches we have got for years and years.We opened all four cans and it was the same thing. I will be sending it back and not ordering again unfortunately.\n",
      "This is so good,  I mix it with almond milk, haven't notice a weight change yet  but it does work to replace meals without feeling like you're starving yourself.\n",
      "LOVE IT\n",
      "Love\n",
      "I have used this product for about 3 weeks and I love it! I just bought 4 more because I am going through it so fast. It curves my hunger and tastes great! I mix it with both water and milk.\n",
      "Same great stuff!\n",
      "sugary, tastes good but not super filling. it just comforts me that I'm getting extra calories.\n",
      "I’m not complaining because I know it says rich chocolate on the bottle so hear me out lol. My first day on it I did what the directions say and I just have a normal blender bottle from amazon (it goes up 600 mL) and I feel as if it tasted super powdery, or too powdery, and really strong. I drank all of it though because I didn’t have expectations of it tasting perfect. Today’s my second day and all of my problems are solved because I did about 9 oz of fat free milk instead of 8 and now I’m acrually drinking it without gagging haha. I wanted to share just in case anybody is like me and can’t take much of rich chocolate.\n",
      "Great deal with coupon offer. Taste just like a chocolate milk shake.\n",
      "tastes great. great price for quantity\n",
      "Drank this for breakfast today and it tasted great and keep me full! It takes just like a chocolate milkshake!\n",
      "This stuff tastes really good, but I was shocked by how much sugar it contains. Taste wise, it tastes like hot chocolate powder and I really like the chocolaty taste. I know this product is made for the soul purpose of curving your appetite, but that isn't really what I got from it. Even after using more than the recommended serving. It's more like a light snack rather than a meal, and I found myself becoming hungry a little while after having it. If I lose any significant amount of weight I may change my review, but for now it doesn't really seem like it's worth the intake of all that sugar when it doesn't even really fill you up.\n",
      "Buying in this size is a significant savings. I mix a a cup of ice, 1 scoop of slimfast, a bit of stevia (0 calorie sweetner), one tablespoon of finely ground coffee beans, a shake of nutmeg, and 6 ounces of non fat milk.. Blend it.  you get an ice cream type consistency you eat with a spoon.. positively delicious.  Add 8 ounces of non fat milk, and its more like a shake.  In 2 years with slimfast, cutting down serving size of meals , and exercise I have lost 55 lbs. Very controlled, no ill effects to my health.  Yes, and drink plenty of water, with an ounce or so of lemon juice. (heat and serve instead of tea.\n",
      "Tastes great.  Decreased appetite\n",
      "I was so surprised! It tastes just like chocolate milk. I drank it up quick. No wonder people chose Slimfast as a meal replacement. I don't know if it really curved my hunger, I bought it for breakfast since I don't eat breakfast. I also bought it to help me get into shape. I actually lost a pound in one day. I don't know if it's related but I haven't eaten less. If anything more than normal because of my protein bars. I'll update when I notice more progress!\n",
      "Helps keep me full I use in morning as a breakfast shake\n",
      "Easy to mix. Tastes great.\n",
      "This meal replacement tastes great and really does help keep me from wanting to snack and eat out of boredom! I drink one for breakfast and lunch and eat a healthy dinner with a few snacks I'm between!\n",
      "SlimFast is a great product, and I used it for many years to help control my weight.  However; over the last few years as I approached 40 it simply stopped working for me.  I enjoyed the taste of the product, as well as how nicely it helped me to both lose weight when I needed to and control when I didn't.  I would recommend SlimFast powders and shakes to anyone.\n",
      "Very thick. I would have for lunch and it would make me have to go poop. I mean the antioxidants are good but I hate having to poop 2 hours after especially at work!\n",
      "Yummy...\n",
      "I didn’t really care for the flavor of this (chocolate) I’ve definitely had better shakes before! After I would drink it I’d feel sick! I dont know if i Just have a weak stomach or what but I won’t be buying this again\n",
      "Plain and simple. Works as stated.\n",
      "Delicious and keeps ya decently full. I drink one for breakfast since I hate/do not have time for regular breakfast foods.\n",
      "This protein shake is so yummy if you're on a diet or just looking for a quick meal I recommend this and for the price it's reasonable.Will buy again.\n",
      "Taste good. So far it does what it says.\n",
      "Love this product. I love the chocolaty taste and its very filling!!!\n",
      "I drink this with a whole banana blended in it. I use a personal size blender to mix, It’s very filling. I have a serious sweet tooth & this keeps me from wanting to eat chocolate bars at breakfast. I’m looking forward to trying it with strawberry.\n",
      "Tastes great! Use it in morning smoothie in addition to fresh strawberries and bananas. I reccomend using 1.5 scoops and 12 ounces of milk if you still feel hungry later. It helped me drop 20lbs in 5 weeks with little change to exercise routine\n",
      "I have been using Slim Fast for several months. I prefer the chocolate flavor. I usually have a light breakfast of either cereal, oatmeal, or toast. I then have a glass of Slim Fast. I do not get any hunger pains for at least 4-5 hrs., unless I am working out or being very active. I will then eat a light meal, and then have another shake. If I do get hungry, I eat a light snack. I have been losing weight, slowly, and have lost approximately 10 lbs over several months. Its going slow, but its staying off. I do go out once in a while and have a nice meal, but I make it low calories. I am very happy with the Slim Fast diet.\n",
      "arrived on time and as advertised\n",
      "great taste, great value\n",
      "Decent size can. Tastes pretty good if you’re not picky. A little grainy but that’s ok. I made mine with ice cubes and a blender a few times and it was good in its own way as well as masking the grainy texture. I also read one review on here when I bought this complaining about scooping out of the can when it gets low. Well people I’m gonna let you in on a highly guarded secret...are you ready for it....turn the can to the side when you get low and allow the powder mix to move closer to the mouth of the can then ba ba ba you’re all done!!\n",
      "Huge and way more affordable than in stores\n",
      "Doesn’t tast that great I added Splenda it helped but the Atkins and premier protein shakes are tasty.\n",
      "Tastes great, but I had absolutely no weight loss results. I used this to replace my breastfast and I had such high hopes. Guess the weight is not going to budge.\n",
      "Speedy service.  I like it.\n",
      "Love this stuff. I mixed mine with water and it was still delicious.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Same as in the store except I didn't have to leave the house!\n",
      "My husband like it.\n",
      "Love this product.  Have it every morning for breakfast before work and it really holds me till lunchtime.\n",
      "One must really read the ingredients and then decide for yourself if this is the product for weight loss that you are looking for. It does have a good taste.\n",
      "However, this may have worked for others but not me.\n",
      "If you stick to the plan you will lose the weight. Just make sure your snacks arent only their little snacks. These shakes are really delicious. I added 1% milk and did 16 oz instead of 8 oz to fill me up more. My snacks were mainly fruits and veggies. Those will FILL YOU UP\n",
      "I love this shake.  I have it every morning..I actually mix it up, place it in the freezer while I get ready for work. As it melts,,  it is like eating a fudgsicle popsicle.  Yummmy......I use Almond Coconut milk....\n",
      "The taste of this is superb, with a daily amount of vitamins and priced right.\n",
      "Cheaper than anywhere else.  You might need a piece of fruit to supplement your meal, but it weirdly make you not hungry.  Not really full, but not hungry either.\n",
      "I liked to make milkshakes out of this, it isn't \"chalky\" like other protein shakes.\n",
      "I love these protein shakes. I mix them with almond milk and ice and it provides the perfect on the go breakfast.\n",
      "I started using to mix to help with my diet. I like to drink a smoothie for breakfast because it's fast, delicious and helps me save my calories and it keeps me from being hungry until lunch time, I have tried other shakes but I this one takes the cake. I have lost 15 pounds using this meal replacement shake over 4 months.  Amazon has the best price, way cheaper than in stores!\n",
      "I have been using Slim Fast powder for the past 20+ years.  It's a great quick breakfast, very filling and yummy made with fresh milk.  I find the canned Slim fast tastes like evaporated milk.  On the days when I eat a large meal, Slim Fast shake mix makes a good small meal to counterbalance it. Like they say, replace two meals with this each day to lose weight, or use it as I do for maintenance. In the past I have only been able to buy these large cans in warehouse clubs, as grocery and drug stores only sell the small cans of powder.  I am thrilled that Amazon sells these large cans.  I can now give up my Warehouse club membership, as I can get everything I go there for on Amazon!\n",
      "None\n",
      "The shake tastes good but i dont think it is a good meal replacement. The product says it will control the hunger for 4 hours but I got hungry and  my stomach was growling after 2 hours or 2 hours 30 minutes. Will not repurchase.\n",
      "it works\n",
      "All good.\n",
      "These shakes taste great! I've replaced my breakfast with a Slim-Fast shake for the last 5 months. Along with a healthier diet and exercise, I've lost 25lbs. I love these shakes.\n",
      "I love this taste but after being on this i didn't lose nothing but 5 lbs after using this for 3 months.I do workout 7 days a week and still didn't lose anything weight,so I switch to a better shake and in 2 days i lose a 1 lb\n",
      "Not using it for weight loss as much as the protein. Have tried a bunch/ not crazy about the fillers but doesn't make me feel sick and great great taste .\n",
      "Perfect price\n",
      "awesome\n",
      "I've lost 4 pounds and I received it a week ago! It really helps me keep my daily intake of calories down. I personally mix it with just water! It tastes amazing, like a brownie!\n",
      "I do not topically believe in this type of products, but I just gave this one a try and it is really working.It keeps me for about 4 hours...\n",
      "Didn't come sealed, just had the regular lid on but no seal to remove. I believe these are supposed to have a seal on them\n",
      "Tastes great! There is a strange, chemically aftertaste to it but it doesn't bother me at all.\n",
      "The first and second time I have tried SlimFast, I did lose some weight. Not a lot, maybe 20 lbs total each time over a few months. However, immediately after the diet, I gained the weight back despite trying to eat healthy. I just recently decided to give it a third try. The first week was harder than I remembered and since my last couple of tries, the formula has changed. I found myself more hungry in between meals than ever and because of that, I started craving meals during the day which lead to cheating early into the diet. And because of how hungry I would be by dinner, my portion sizes were bigger than they would've been had I just eaten healthy throughout the day. I will be returning what I've purchased and continue my weight loss journey through healthy eating and exercise. This is all, of course, my experience. I wish everyone else the best - everyone's body reacts differently to diets, especially when it comes to meal replacement shakes.\n",
      "Delicious for a weight loss shake!\n",
      "My wife and I have both lost weight using Slim Fast. I've lost 15 lbs and she's lost 17 lbs (in 7 weeks).  Tastes really good (not the bad tasting Slim Fast of the '80s/90's) and makes us feel full. Tastes best when you follow the blender directions with ice but a quick stir in a glass of milk (also in directions) is not bad at all. It is slowly helping us get used to reducing calories/food portions in our diet.  We usually have one for breakfast, sometimes one for breakfast and one for lunch, but otherwise eat normal healthy food and even cheat sometimes on the weekends. Sometimes we prefer a shake for lunch rather than something else...it tastes that good.  Good luck!\n",
      "This review is for the Chocolate Royale. The flavor is great! I use a scoop every morning in my blender bottle with 2% milk and lots of ice as a breakfast meal replacement. It reduces my appetite for the rest of the day and I would then eat small portions for lunch and dinner.  I have lost 28 lbs in 4 months so far without exercising.\n",
      "I replace 1-2 meals a day with a shake mixed with almond milk; extremely delicious. Tastes like a milkshake just not as thick. Highly recommend as a meal replacement.\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Have used product for a number of years....Results with use as expected.\n",
      "Tastes good, only time will tell if it works.\n",
      "Replaced dinner with one serving. Lost about 7 lbs first two weeks. Then got stuck again. Added lots of ice and mixed in blended. Good taste.\n",
      "lsimfast is the best\n",
      "I use to always purchase these from Walmart, but with this larger size you get such a better deal!I will repurchase when needed.\n",
      "As advertised\n",
      "Bargain product. Delicious taste.\n",
      "Great Product!\n",
      "great\n",
      "Giving it 4 stars because I thought it was more protein per scoop but it's only 10g which isn't a meal it's a snack. But i mix it with skim milk in blender bottle and it taste great and eat with a 10g protein bar for breakfast\n",
      "Tastes yummy, and makes me feel full, so no hunger pangs nor cravings.  The last time I bought it, and had one or two shakes a day, drank about 40 ounces of water a day, I lost 13 lbs in 7 days! (I started with 2 small cups -16 oz of water- upon waking up, after brushing teeth, and avoided flour.  I only drink water with lime or lemon, or tea/coffee with a dash of agave syrup, and  no fast food).  SlimFast is great because you truly enjoy it, and it works!!!\n",
      "Slimfast is definitely a long term weight loss investment. For me its perfect because even though i am overweight i realized i never ate enough so with this i started actually eating a meal in between 2 shakes. One in the morning and one at night with the meal in between. Its made me feel better because before i never ate because i never felt like it. So far in a month ive lost maybe 5 pounds but that was without exercise but now im working a hard labor job so im hoping to up my results.\n",
      "Very good scale if you want a rough estimate of your weight. The only problem is that it is not consistent. One hour I'll be x pounds and the next day I'll somehow have gained or lost 5-8 pounds. Highly would recommend checking all of your options before buying but, like said, it does give a fairly decent \"estimated\" weight.\n",
      "Does what it says, tastes great.\n",
      "Supplement for two meals a day is working for me\n",
      "This is about the only place I can order the Slimfast - very pleased.\n",
      "For the price and the size can't beat it.\n",
      "Very gppd.\n",
      "Good meal replacement, quick and easy to use.\n",
      "convenient size\n",
      "Awesome\n",
      "Tastes great EXCEPT (or perhaps I should say because), the first ingredient is sugar.  Way too much sugar for me.\n",
      "Fast shipping, good price. Thanks!\n",
      "Great\n",
      "Definitely worth it.  Makes great frosties\n",
      "The chocolate royale tastes amazing with almond coconut milk. I have replaced 2 meals a day for a week and I'm already down 4 lbs. I usually replace breakfast and lunch with some snacks in between and have a healthy regular dinner portion. Thumbs up!!\n",
      "Tastes fantastic. I use coconut milk, so I add some PB2 powder for a little extra protein. I'm hungry in EXACTLY 4 hours. I have lost weight, although not sure how much. It keeps me on point with calorie counts and is SUPER easy for breakfast and lunch (I actually love not having to deal with 2 meals a day).\n",
      "Gave me diarrhea every time I drank it.\n",
      "Good meal replacement. I use soy & other non dairy milk because of lactose intolerance. Pleased with taste & results.\n",
      "TY\n",
      "Taste great! Love it.\n",
      "Lost 20 lbs already but this depends on a person. I did a serious calorie diet and this helped me lose weight. I drink this every night instead of eating a meal. Sometimes I'll have a little snack along with it. Very good flavor and I love it with fat free milk. Fat free milk taste like nothing but this powder gives a little sweet in it. Perfect! I'm on my 2nd can.\n",
      "This is the best protein drink, and ive tried many.\n",
      "This stuff is heaven in a can! I have amazon prime shipping so I received it in the same day! So I bought a blender bottle on Amazon too. I barely started using this two days ago, I use one whole banana, unsweetened almond milk, ice, and I add one spoon of matcha green tea and a full scoop (the scoop) that comes in the can of the slim fast protein powder. This stuff is amazing! The first day I tried it was around eight in the morning and I felt energized, no cravings through out the whole day and it was already three thirty and I didn't even realize it because I usually get hungry by 12:00 and I wasn't! I wasn't even hungry by 3:30 pm but I ate something small anyways!This meal replacement shake is great, like I can't stop gushing over it. Some people take this in the morning for breakfast and dinner but it keeps me so full that I just take it in the mornings eat two snacks and lunch and that's it. I'm not hungry, I am really suprised because I am a bigger girl always eating and snacking.I will forever be in love with this, I can't wait to see results!! Obviously eating less and smaller portions will help you lose weight! Plus this stuff taste like a real chocolate smoothie not even like a protein shake. It's really good!This definitely curves your appetite, if your looking for something to help you feel energized, full, curve your cravings this is it!\n",
      "Great price and it has a good taste. Fast delivery from Amazon.\n",
      "Really does keep me full for long periods of time. I'm losing weight by drinking one shake in the morning. A 300-500 calorie lunch at 3pm. Then another shake at 8pm. I may or not have a 100 calorie snack in between each meal.\n",
      "I haven't weighed myself to see if I have lost weight, but I love this stuff! I have never tried something that curbed my appetite like this?! And, it taste GREAT!  I haven't tired any of the other flavors, but this one in particular is delicious! As in, I look forward to drink it, not dreading getting through it lol!  I use this alongside with Myfitnesspal app, and I truly find myself making sure I have ENOUGH calories logged in for the day! I can not wait to check my weight in a few days as I can tell just by the way my clothes are fitting that there is some change.  (Not that my clothes are hanging off me by any means, lol, just looking better on me).  I am a mom of 4 in her late 40's and have never struggled with weight, until recently, and wow, is it hard to take off at this age!  This has been a blessing and I can not wait to update this post with any actual weight loss!\n",
      "Came quickly! Tastes great with cinnamon or banana mixed in!!\n",
      "One of the cake I ordered was neutered and the wrapping was ripped. This doesn't affect the product but I was still bummed out.\n",
      "I have been using this for several months.  I have lost 18# pounds using it in the morning.  The chocolate is great.  I wake up looking forward to it.  Blender really suggested.  One level scoop of SlimFast, 1/2 cup of 2% milk, 1/2 cup of ice water and about 11 ice cubes. my look like 1/2 moons through the door ice.  Blend on high for 45 seconds.  Golly I am hungry for one right now.  Have  one at lunch and a reasonable dinner.No need to have one after dinner.  You have already had your calories.  Eat something like carrots, or celery to calm your stomach.  The craving go away, you are use to sugar.  Don't eat cereal. It is sugar and useless carbs. trust me. I have been there many times.  from a size 18 in women's I am now below a 12 in womens, 34 in men's.  Few more to go.  Today is 178  down from 197 and feeling bad.\n",
      "taste good great price.\n",
      "ok\n",
      "The package indicated that a scoop was included, I opened it and there was no scoop. Also, the outside of the tin was slightly damaged. However, neither of these are really a big deal. I'll live.I got the royale chocolate flavor, it taste so good! Kind of like liquid chocolate cake!Overall, this is a wonderful product!\n",
      "Taste delicious and very chocolatey\n",
      "Just recieved this 2 days ago, and hands down this is the BEST meal replacement I've ever tried. Tastes just like a milkshake when mixed with unsweetened vanilla almond milk. Too soon to think I've lost weight with this yet but it truly keeps me full for hours....I almost feel too full! Can't wait to see what I look like a month from now while using this, exercising 5 days a week and trying to eat healthy!\n",
      "This stuff is amazing! Tastes so good and is not chalky at all. Love it!\n",
      "I have to watch my dairy intake . So I mix the powder with water . The chocolate is good to my taste as is . The French Vanilla is a little bland for me . So I add a 1/2 a TSP of vanilla extract to it and enjoy it now as well .Marvin\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "Nice large container. I remember them being much smaller years ago. Same great taste though. I have a smoothie every morning with a 1/2 cup frozen berries and 1 cup light vanilla soy milk. Delicious.\n",
      "Been using as a two times a day meal replacement for a week and already lost 4 pds. This flavor tastes fantastic. My husband is even doing this diet with me and he hates dieting!\n",
      "Taste so good and way cheaper then the $50 brand I got locally\n",
      "Love the chocolate it's amazing and it's works price was good.\n",
      "They actually taste great! Like real chocolate milk, I have to be careful not to drink too much hahaha...\n",
      "Lost a pound per week.  Best way to loose weight.\n",
      "To be clear, the first ingredient is sugar and the third is oil. This isn't really that healthy. I mean, it's better than soloing on a large pizza, but. I dunno if I would use it as a stand alone meal replacement.I use this to make the  organic garden of Life Fit meal replacement taste a little better. Mix it will ice and almond milk (unsweetened) and it works as a meal replacement that will tie me over for hours.I will start using this at dinner, I am notorious for non+stop late night grazing. When I'm decompressing from the day I seem to develop hand to mouth disease.  This helps prevent that\n",
      "I'll give it a 2 star because it tastes amazing but while following the 2 shakes and 1 meal a day plus 2 healthy snacks I ended up gaining 7 lbs!!\n",
      "I've been drinking this for many years. Great at bedtime to stop the snacking\n",
      "Really great taste. Used with regular milk and almond milk.\n",
      "Best shake ever!!!! I have had lots of brands the most expensive \"best quality\" shakes. This is by far the best ever!! Drink it with some sugar free  vanilla almond milk and it tastes just like one of those fudge popsicles! I'm not kidding...just like it!! I could think 1000000 of them lol and for only 110cal \"200\" with the almond milk you can beat it.  No one offered me a free shake or money off I'm honestly giving you my opinion.\n",
      "I'll buy it again\n",
      "I had my first shake this morning and am very pleased with the taste and texture of this product. I mixed the shake with fat free milk and a half banana and really enjoyed it. It's not grainy or too thick which was perfect for me. The price for this huge can is a great deal and I will be buying again. I think SlimFast got it right with this formula!\n",
      "Love this! Jump-starting my weight loss program with this. I'm counting calories so this is perfect with part cow milk and part chocolate almond milk. I add truvia for extra sweetener without calories. I have a sweet tooth. With the ice into the magic bullet and it's a great breakfast milkshake.\n",
      "Just got this really didnt think It would taste as good as pre made slim fast but much to my surprise it is very tasty ... Reminders me of chocolate milk.. Yummy!!!!\n",
      "GOOD FLAVOR, IT IS A MEAL REPLACEMENT... NOT A CHEESEBURGER, IT SHOULDN'T BE THE TASTIEST ITEM YOU'RE EVER GOING TO EAT... THAT'S THE REASON YOU'RE ORDERING THIS TO BEGIN WITH!\n",
      "good\n",
      "Lost 20lbs on this.  It taste great and works if you follow the directions.\n",
      "Lets just talk about the flavor... so so so DELICIOUS!!!!!\n",
      "On my second order. Flavor is great and it kept me full throughout the day. Occasionally I'd add cinnamon just to spice it up a bit. Very good.\n",
      "as advertised\n",
      "It tastes good and is much more filling that some alternatives.\n",

      "I'll admit I drink this for the taste of it, and to maintain my weight during the holidays, love this stuff!\n",
      "perfect\n",
      "Its pretty good... Tastes sorta like the Dark Chocolate Silk, I mix mine with coffee for breakfast and its a great way to start the day.\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "this is my second  one  and its soo good wow all i can say is 5 stars thank you\n",
      "Always arrived on time.  Can not dented or damaged EVER.\n",
      "great tasting shake\n",
      "Great stuff!\n",
      "Always a great product. Cost was right also\n",
      "It's okay, I just wish there wasn't any artificial sweeteners there is a little aftertaste. Other than that, the size is good for the price.. the results are good along with eating healthy, you lose a few pounds as this is a meal replacement shake. Good for those counting calories\n",
      "Amazing product ! 100% RECOMMENDED.\n",
      "For the price, this meal replacement shake is my go-to powder.  I simply add water and frozen fruit.  Helps curb my cravings and with my busy workday, it helps me when I forget that I need to be eating more than I am.\n",
      "Same great tasted as the prepared canned Slimfast but seems more wholesome using fresh skim milk not to mention it is cheaper than the prepared drinks. Had to buy a little battery powered mixer to get a nice smooth drink. Good stuff, a get supplement to my diet and weight loss efforts.\n",
      "tasty!\n",
      "Taste so yummy I could drink it all day, I had lost 15 pounds in 2 months using this and exercising\n",
      "Just as described.\n",
      "I have to say I was very hesitant to even try a program like this, how good does it taste, how will I not be hungry, will it even work. Well I have to say WOW this stuff works and tastes great. This is just what I needed to jump start my weight loss program. I have been on the program for just a little over 10 days and lost 8lbs in the first week, but not without a little hard work. I also started a new fitness program with cardio and weights, only been to the gym 5 times in those 10 days. I feel great, have more energy & I have already received compliments that I look thinner. With all that said, I still have a life and have not given up on all of those guilty pleasures. I still enjoy a few adult beverages a few nights a week and I am not one to shy away from a great meal, and yet the program works for me. Here is the plan that is working for me.For breakfast I make a shake, anywhere from 8-12 oz.Sometimes I try to FORCE myself to eat a snack, I have numerous healthy snack bars that are around 150 calories each.For lunch I have the same shake, 8-12oz servingSame deal for the afternoon snack, this is my struggling point. I have breakfast at 5:30, lunch around 12 and dinner around 6 so sometimes I need an extra snack to get me to dinner, sometimes I don't.For dinner I pretty much eat whatever I want meat wise and load up on veggies. No pasta, No taters, No rice, No bread.Use Almond milk, I believe this is a big part of my weight loss program. I use a Vanilla flavored 60 calorie Almond Milk in my shakes and I think it saves me about a 100 calories on the 2 shakes and that is why I eat a little extra at dinner. At the end of the day my calorie intake ends up anywhere from 12-1500, sometimes less sometimes more......... but its working for me.I'm also taking Garcinia Cambogia 3 times daily before each meal, But I have no idea if the stuff works or if its one of those hyped up nothing pills.But the biggest reason a program like this works is COMMITMENT, you have to want it to work and you have to put in effort to get results.\n",
      "Tastes GREAT, but the number one ingredient is SUGAR. Due to that, I am hungry a couple hours later, so not much of a meal replacement. And not that greater you- I should've done my homework on it before buying.\n",
      "Not a bad meal replacement for the price.Add fruit and it gives the more expensive ones some stiff competition.\n",
      "Love this stuff\n",
      "I've already gone through a can of this. When I drink it with skim or almond milk, I add a little extra of the powder. Comes with a little cup. It taste like chocolate milk of course. Keeps me full like a real meal would. I drink it in the morning when I don't have a lot of time or when I'm hungry but don't want to cook. I put it in a blender bottle.\n",
      "Excellent product I'll buy it again.\n",
      "Tastes great with amazing hunger control.\n",
      "This stuff can be very good if you prepare it correctly. I make it with skim milk and add a few ice cubes*, then blend it with a serious electric blender (I use a 900 watt NutriNinja). The pulverized ice makes the drink a lot colder and a bit thicker, so it's more like an actual shake.I have two shakes a day. One each for breakfast and lunch. Sometimes, for my lunch shake, I'll add a teaspoon of smooth peanut butter. Adds just a hint of peanut butter cup to the flavor. Of course, adding PB means adding some fat and sugar (unless you use a PB that's only made from peanuts; then it's just a bit of vegetable fat), but it also adds a little bit of protein. And it makes a change from the standard flavor.The only gripe I have is that there aren't more flavors. The Chocolate Royale is tasty, but it gets monotonous, and I don't care for vanilla or strawberry. (Hence the occasional teaspoon of peanut butter added to the mix.)*For reference, these are cubes from a standard ice tray. I use trays because my ice maker died. If you have an ice maker that produces those crescent-shaped \"cubes,\" you might want to use four or more.\n",
      "I had used this years ago for weight loss but now I use it when I am on the go. But I use it with whole milk since I don't need it for weight loss\n",
      "This is my favorite. Always worked great for me. Too bad Step daughter used it all on me.\n",
      "Yummy and filling.\n",
      "This is excellent.  It actually tastes like a chocolate shake that you'd get at a diner.  I was very surprised, because the SlimFast French Vanilla powder was so horrible, after gagging on it, I threw it all down the garbage disposal.  YUK!  I love this flavor and am on my second container of it.\n",
      "Easy to make and lasts a long time.  The taste is incredible.  I just shake it up in a tumbler.\n",
      "fine\n",
      "works well\n",
      "Been having these and meals bars for breakfast and lunch the last couple weeks, already lost 10lbs.\n",
      "Tasted good.  But easier to eat low calorie meals\n",
      "Sooooo yummy! and HUGE! I've bought this 2 times already. It last a really long time. Not at all like the smaller containers\n",
      "Didn't really curb my hunger but it sure did taste good\n",
      "taste good\n",
      "I like the taste and the consistency.But boy, it sure produces a lot of gas in my stomach. I have to pass wind frequently and this is embarrassing at work.\n",
      "Good Taste and value. Better than i expected.\n",
      "Taste great and less expensive than alot of the overpriced shakes alot of other companies try and sale. The only problem i have is it doesnt do very good with curbing my appetite.\n",
      "This one is pretty damn Delicious to me. I like it a lot I actually look forward to making one. I make it in the Smoothie blender. I even add ice to it and it's delicious for me.\n",
      "nice price\n",
      "I recieved this last week and have been drinking it ever since with light exercises and in 7 days I have lost 2lb. Now imagine if I started working out more hours and more intensely. I'll probably lose even more weight in the next week! I'm an more than happy with this product. For some people it doesn't work but I'm so happy it worked out for me. Great chocolatey taste,not chalky or anything and great for smoothies. Love it!\n",
      "So I thought I'd give this a try after using esofemme for a while. I ended up gaining weight and threw it away. I wouldn't recommend this product at all.\n",
      "I am going on week 4 on the Slim Fast diet and I have dropped 10 pounds. My husband joined me during my second week on the diet, and as of week 3 he has also lost 10 pounds. We only recently started adding exercise to our weight loss journey (hiking...around week 5 I'm going to add in Yoga at least once a week).A little bit of background information...I am 5'1''. I have had two children within a year of each other. But I've always struggled with weight, as I am the type of person that could look at food and gain weight. I also love to drink calories through sweetened coffee/tea, soda, etc. I no longer drink soda and took up unsweetened iced tea. I add 1/2 cup of black coffee to my Slim Fast shake in the AM and I always blend 1/2 cup of ice to my shakes.I finally realized that this weight wasn't going anywhere without a real plan to lose it. I'm busy homeschooling our children, and need something that's easy peasy. My formula.... Love To Drink Calories + Easy = Slim Fast.The first two weeks were torture. But I was determined to stick with it. Getting from meal to snack, to meal to snack, and so on and so forth was very difficult at first as it seemed to weigh on my mind too much..all I thought about was food. By the end of week 2 I was past that and sometimes I would forget to eat a snack! Yay!I am also eating much healthier now. I am getting my dairy (2 cups a day through Slimfast), as well as eating salads, fruits, veggies and grains. To also help with my calorie counting and eating healthier meals I started buying Lean Cuisine meals at my local grocer. It also didn't occur to me until I started Slim Fast that fruits and veggies are low in calories and don't seem to have fat calories....it's what nature intended us to eat. I can have a Lean Cuisine meal (let's just say for example sake) for roughly 350 calories and then have a whole plate full of various vegetables and fruits.  For on the go snacks, I also like the Special K granola bars for 100 calories and their 80 calorie brownies.I hope those who have my read my review find encouragement and stick to this weightloss plan for at least a couple of months. For weightloss, the experts always say consistency is the key.  SlimFast is a great way to be consistent.My tips:- I prefer to make my 500-600 calorie meal at Lunch. It makes it easier to get through the day.- Blend 1/2 cup of ice to your shakes and it's much more filling.- Add 1/2 cup of coffee to your morning shake.- Buy tons of canned fruits and veggies. Stock your pantry and you have easy snacks and sides to meals.- Explore other weightloss brands and possibly combine them. Frozen meals, to snack bars, desserts etc.- Mrs. Dash is a great seasoning for turkey burgers, etc as it has 0 calories and no sodium compared to other seasonings.- Unsweetened Almond Milk is a good alternative to skim milk. I have read several reviewers who said they couldn't lose weight using Skim milk until they switched over to Unsweetened almond milk as they were lactose intolerant.This is what I've learned in the first 3.5 weeks. I'm down 10 pounds and need to lose 25-30 more. Good luck! We can all do this!!\n",
      "Good and cheapest prices in Walgreens Stores,\n",
      "This is working as expected.\n",
      "Best price around and tastes great blended with ice, almond milk and half a banana\n",
      "Fantastic taste . Fills my stomach every time\n",
      "This actually tastes better than I expected. I remember drinking my mother's Slimfast as a child and it tasted like you'd expect a diet shake to taste, this powder however is so yummy I look forward to drinking it. I also feel full after a shake, I wholely recommend it .\n",
      "Always the same. No surprises.\n",
      "It tastes great and keeps me full and satisfied. The texture is not chalky or grainy like other shakes on the market.\n",
      "So yummy.\n",
      "It helped me loose 15 lbs in 2 months. Of course not only drinking this but also eating right and exercising\n",
      "I like slim fast shakes. In my opinion, the chocolate is the best flavor. It definitely keeps me full for 4+ hours.\n",
      "Have been using this product for a few years and I works I have lost the weight I needed along with working out.\n",
      "Been using SlimFast a long time.  Love the taste!\n",
      "Have used for a week.  Shake is delicious but no change in weight noticed even though I've followed the 321 plan.\n",
      "I used this meal plan specifically for a three month period and was able to lose 19 lbs...and have been using it for another 4 months after for maintenance.  I did also run daily this whole time.  I recommend it to people all the time but if you want to build muscle there are better alternatives with higher protein amounts.\n",
      "The taste is great, but it really doesn't keep you full for very long. 2 hours tops for me. I was hoping it would replace lunch and I could hold off eating again until dinner, but I was starving in between and the hunger hit me hard.\n",
      "The Slim Fast Meal replacement is good tasting and if you follow the directions for use you can lose weight.  I prefer this option as I can use the milk of my choice.  Just my opinion.\n",
      "It comes right on time.  It's delicious and it's working.\n",
      "Best price you can find ANYWHERE! I have 1-2 shakes per day to cut out the calories and try to slim down. Note that the sugar content is quite high in comparison to other protein shakes. I mix with unsweetened cashew milk and occasionally some fruit, peanut butter or cold coffee.\n",
      "excellent tastes great\n",
      "Tastes great!\n",
      "Best cost Slimfast available. I've mixed with Almond milk and traditional dairy of all percentages and it always tastes good. I work 1st shift in a very physical environment and need something that i can prepare easily at 4am  and it keeps me not thinking about food for about 5 or 6 hours. Have it everyday!\n",
      "Love it. Lasts FOREVER\n",
      "Works well\n",
      "Just as advertised and available in the \"big cans\" from Amazon and no other store has the big cans.\n",
      "Too many carbs and sugar\n",
      "The taste of this Slim Fast is excellent. Mixed with milk it is a delicious drink, and blended with ice and/or a fruit it is an indulgent treat. It keeps me full so I am less likely to snack on a high calorie food. The texture is not gritty or powdery and can easily be blender by stirring or shaking.\n",
      "Works, tastes good.  Nothing else to say.\n",
      "Order came very fast and was as advertised.\n",
      "great!\n",
      "Great value.  This container is about 3 times as big as the normal one so it has lasted quite awhile.\n",
      "Yummy, smooth and chocolatey.\n",
      "so here's the deal I love the taste it's not to grainy it very smooth and since I am a chocolate lover it's right up my alley.. now for the consit does suppress the appetite. but for me it lasts only two hours.. then I have to go for one of the slim fast calorie packs combines with applesauce or a piece of fruit.. I am also lactose intolerant so I am going to have to try lactated milk instead... I also  added ice, bananas and strawberries along with the shake for a thick shake sooo good hope this helps,\n",
      "Works great, truely makes you feel full!  Much better price when bought this way\n",
      "Great stuff. Mixes well and tastes good.\n",
      "This stuff tastes good and is easy to mix up. But unless you use milk with it you are not going to get the protein count they say. I use Almond Milk and found out I was not getting the protein I needed.\n",
      "Slim Fast is a great replacement shake, I have used it in the past and lost 25 pounds. You also must exercise and watch what you eat. This is a great price on this product and shipping was fast.\n",
      "Good bargain!  Slimfast has become very expensive in my local drugstores and supermarkets and this is a great alternative.  Wish they had more flavors in this size.  I get skinnier just lthinking avout it.\n",
      "Love it!\n",
      "The consistency and quality taste is always good. I do not use this exclusively for weight loss but also for meal replacement when I do not have time to prepare. It does make 34 shakes and is easy to use. I use this with a blender cup and add ice or banana. Shipping was fast and on time and item was received in good condition. 4 stars due to high sugar content and some ingredients that I find acceptable but not ideal.\n",
      "Great stops hunger really works\n",
      "The taste is good and it is easy to follow through with. It holds me over till lunch if I drink it in the morning. I have adjusted the rest of my diet since I started using the shakes so I can't pin all of my weight-loss on the shakes but it has helped me with my dieting a lot.\n",
      "I just purchased the Chocolate Royal shake and it taste amazing. I used the product detail on the canister to make the shake using 1 scoop of the mix, 8oz of 1%milk and a couple of ice cubes (taste great and very thick). I decided to switch things up and use just water instead of milk which cuts down the calorie intake and help with my lactose intolerance. I mix 16oz of water and 2 scoops of the shake mix. This mix was more filling (6 hours) and it adds up to be around the same amount of calories/less. Water has no calories so initially I am only taking in 220 calories and feel very much full. In addition I do use this as  meal replacement for breakfast while adding 1 banana each morning to this breakfast. Based on my google research 1 banana adds up to be 121 calories so in all for breakfast I only have 341 calories. Slim fast is a very great and cash efficient product for weight loss. I've tried other meal replacement Shakes (GNC) which are very good but also very costly. I suggest for any starters in weight loss, try slim fast first then progress to the more expensive products later if your trying to build muscle/etc. I am going to start using this as 2 meal replacements a day for one month in addition to 1 portion size regular meal and moderate exercise and I will return with my weight loss average.May 1, 2016 my starting weight 181.6lbs.Exercise M,W,F 1 mile jog, 45 push ups, 45 set ups, 1 mile walk  T,TH  3 mile walk(treadmill), 45 pull ups, 45 squatsPortion size meals- 1 meat/fish & 2 vegetables\n",
      "great to make smoothies\n",
      "favorite thing ever!\n",
      "Deducted a star because it didn't fill me up. But it's tasty.\n",
      "good price. tastes good\n",
      "Good ol slim fast tastes amazing.\n",
      "It arrived in one day. I mixed one scoop of Slimfast with 8 oz of unsweetened almond milk in my blender bottle. It tastes amazing and kept me full.\n",
      "Love the way I tastes and even just one scoop with a cup of almond milk keeps me full for hours! I would definitely recommend getting this!\n",
      "Lost over 100 lbs in an extreme Slim-Fast only diet. Two shakes and a bar for dinner. I might have done irreparable damage to my metabolism, but the self-confidence I gained was worth it.\n",
      "Huge container\n",
      "Excellent drink mix, I love this stuff.  I use it regularly to make shakes, not for a diet drink.  I do normally mix in some ice cream or ice chunks to get it very thick.\n",
      "Ok - for substitute meal...I use 1% milk\n",
      "I use my Magic Bullet for 2 shakes a day which I find quite good for a snack. I fill the Magic Bullet half way with cubed ice, a little skim milk & 1 scoop which makes a 12 ounce shake for less then 200 calories.\n",
      "Awesome smooth taste\n",
      "My midnight go to snack...\n",
      "Well, this stuff is pretty much the standby for meal replacement diet shakes. After all these years I still love it! It easy, convenient, tastes good, and keeps me full. I recently went on a diet using this twice a day along with Atrafex \n",
      "Atrafen Thermogenic Fat Burner & Appetite Suppressant\n",
      " , and I gotta say, I am pretty impressed. Losing 2-3 pounds every single week, and I am very close to my goal weight.\n",
      "I substitute this for lunch everyday, In the past month ive lost 18 lbs.  WITH-OUT exercise, I eat 2 of those styrofoam tasting wafer things for breakfast, slim fast for lunch, and a regular full dinner.\n",
      "Tastes good, and works well, would recommend to anyone!\n",
      "Good product.\n",
      "Great taste easily mixes.\n",
      "Great taste, easy to mix and when you stick to an actual diet it helps you lose weight\n",
      "A daily source of nutrition and it's Chocolate!\n",
      "Very tasty. I was surprised. I used plain almond milk.\n",
      "I never saw this size before. Great money saver. The dates on the cans have all been good. I buy this regularly now.\n",
      "Great tasting and love it.\n",
      "In the past, the scales would not budge.  I have lost 6 lbs so far.  It does control your appetite.  I like the flavor.\n",
      "Tastes great! They fill me up but not for the full four hours.\n",
      "Been having this for over 2 weeks. Quite filling and makes me eat less. I replace one meal with this shake normally for breakfast or dinner.\n",
      "At first I was really iffy on getting this because I didn't know if it would taste good or not. And I knew that if I didn't like the taste, I wouldn't drink it. And OMG I love this! I am a chocolic and absolutely love this product. And it makes a decent sized drink so it takes a while to drink and it really does fill you up. Love this product. 5 STAR!!\n",
      "Loved this product! It helped me lose and keep off 25 lbs! I started eating clean and drank this to substitute one meal (and ate something small like a banana with it). I'm currently pregnant, but will definitely use this in the future to help shed the baby weight.\n",
      "I've been using Slim Fast for over a year.  They taste wonderful as the powder/milk mixture, but the pre-made bottles are disgusting.  Slim Fast is a great calorie substitute and with determination and self-discipline, your body will adapt to just drinking a shake in the morning and at lunch.  I eat fruit along with my lunch shake.  You will not want to eat food because this will take place of the calories you would otherwise have consumed, but these are healthy calories with great nutrition.  Best of all, you save money by not buying food.  Of course, if you want to lose weight, you need to avoid unhealthy sodas and you need to exercise.  Drinking a shake is only part of it.\n",
      "The order arrived as promised in excellent condition.\n",
      "Wife has used this for years.  I use the pre-mixed bottles myself.  Tastes good, especially the Rich Chocolate Royale flavor.  We think it works well as part of an overall eating-control plan.  We usually have one for breakfast, and sometimes for dinner.\n",
      "taste great but it has too much sugar in it.\n",
      "Enjoy the taste. Good in water and skim milk.\n",
      "It's misleading. It doesn't have much protein. The protein is in the milk.\n",
      "Omg. This is the most delicious meal replacement I've tried. I mixed 8 oz of vanilla unsweetened almond milk with one scoop and shook. No lumps, clumps, no chalky taste. It tastes like a chocolate milkshake and totally satisfied my sweet tooth which has been ruining all my cardio. I'm hoping replacing dinner with this will allow me to shed some weight quicker. Yummmmmm!\n",
      "happy with purchase\n",
      "This tastes sooooo good. Nothing like their canned shakes which taste like a jar of vitamins to me. It's made in milk and tastes great. Easy to mix. I under a blender ball.\n",
      "Great taste, smooth and creamy.\n",
      "Slimfast shake powder is designed to give you a full complement of nutrients except sugar and fat, and it does this by using an artificial sweetener.  I mix with 1% milk and the taste is not bad, but it will never compete with a real chocolate shake with 10 times the calories.  Don't try to visualize a real chocolate shake.  Sometimes I add half a banana and/or some raw almonds, with a few ice cubes, in which case the blender has to run for at least 30 seconds.  I am pre-diabetic and test my blood sugar regularly.  Doing the slimfast diet  (2 shakes and one real meal per day), my blood sugar dropped into normal ranges at both fasting and post-eating tests.  I have to say, though, that when I tried to reduce the carb portion of my daily real meal, my energy levels dropped so low I could hardly exercise.  All in all, I think this is the best \"diet\" product around,  I used it 12 years ago to drop 30 pounds and I am confident it will work again.  Oh, and because this product has fiber, it promotes good bowel health.\n",
      "The first thing we are taught when leArning out to understand labels... is what is the first ingredient. Here we have it, SUGAR. And in a diet drink which is SUPPOSED TO BE formulated to help people LOSE WEIGHT. this makes no sense. That's why this product work for those active on their feet all day... it is not meant for couch sitters who take walks or work out 3 days a week for twenty minutes at a time. They can easily reformulate it and use a low carb sweerener and reduce the calories to 150. So, all in all... it is not a product made to help you lose weight. Perhaps for someone who needs to drop 10 pounds in sixty days. So the idea here is to get the consumer hooked and make us feel like we are failing ourselves as oppsed to the realty, the product is failing us. If we all lost good weight, they feel we would nit need the product anymore. How stupid. We buy more. Reformulate it and take out the sugar... low carb it. Tried Atkins it sucks. No weight loss.\n",
      "Convenient to buy on Amazon with the monthly scheduled shipments.  I blend it with Ice, 2 percent milk, and a small bit of banana and it tastes great!\n",
      "The perfect blend of make you feel full vs im just drinking a shake for lunch.\n",
      "Okay so I am not usually into chocolate but this tastes pretty good.  I feel like a little kid again drinking my chocolate milk.  :)I use Almond milk instead of regular milk so that cuts the calorie count down to about 140-170 depending on the type I use.  Actually, I am currently using a mixture of Almond and Cashew milk and that is only 25 calories which makes this drink 135!  So sometimes I will eat a little something on the side with it.  Regardless I have snacks in between each meal.  I lost about 5 pounds within the first week!  If you follow it pretty closely (two shakes, three snacks, and a 500 cal meal) and you stay within your daily calorie goal (try LoseIt or MyFitnessPal, also SparkPeople) on top of a little bit of daily exercise (I do Zumba, walking, a little bit of jogging around the couch, etc) then it should work for you as well!  I used it every day during the week days and then I take a break on the weekends (I still try to stay within my calorie limit though).  I have also recently started incorporating their meal replacement bars since it gets tiring having shakes for breakfast and lunch everyday, never thought I'd say that!  But yea, it does work if you put in the effort.  I started at around 151 and I am now down to 144.  Not bad so far.  :)\n",
      "Tastes great. My 4 yr old son loves this too. Last a long time\n",
      "Good value. Tastes good\n",
      "Makes a great shake.  I add a banana and crushed ice and follow directions and it is really good.\n",
      "I was actually really excited to receive this..until I did. It's my own fault for not researching it enough or paying attention to the label. I didn't realize just how much sugar and carbs are in one little scoop! Yeah it may help you lose weight at first, but you are sure to gain it right back because you are addicted to all the carbs you got from it. The plus side of it is that it does taste good, even with only using water. I usually felt hungry again only after a couple hours though, so it's tough to not feel the need to use double the amount I have of it in one sitting. It's not all bad, but don't expect to keep the weight off after getting off of this stuff and  like I said, it has a lot going against it when it comes to the sugar, carb, and sodium content.\n",
      "...it's hard to stick to. Nothing wrong with the product as it can work as advertised. The problem is me.\n",
      "This is my go to breakfast.  It is filling and tastes delicious.\n",
      "Great as usual.\n",
      "Excellent product..easy to use..very tastefull\n",

      "Makes good shake\n",
      "This is so yummy!!! I can't get enough of it! Better than chocolate milk. It taste just like a milk shake. I didn't buy this product for the diet, I bought it because I eat a lot of chocolate and I was hoping it would help with my cravings and it absolutely does. I have noticed I have been buying way less candy!!\n",
      "I can't say how the product works as the container came damaged with holes and it did not have an expiry date. Thankfully I got a rebate.\n",
      "It's a little sweet and it upsets my tummy slightly. It does taste good though and is better blended with almond milk, ice and maybe a banana. I've also blended with coffee and that is good as well.\n",
      "Great Product!!\n",
      "Came quick and is what I order although it had a huge dent. Photo to follow :/\n",
      "Great product. Have used it for lunch for years instead of solid food, etc.  Maintaining my weight.\n",
      "Blends so well and such a great replacement for solid food while having dental issues!\n",
      "Couldnt find for years! love this product!\n",
      "Nom nom love the taste\n",
      "as described--fast shipping\n",
      "Always loved this product. Like to mix it myself. Tastes great!\n",
      "Definitely curbed my hunger and would get me through the day with minimal desire to eat/snack.  Went from 236lbs down to 222lbs.  Note though, I used skim milk and drank this religiously for about a month for breakfast, lunch, and, two weeks before my physical fitness test, I also start supplementing it for dinner as well.  It tastes good and was not a hardship to consume unlike other products.  Hit me up with any questions. Cheers\n",
      "Perfect!\n",
      "Very good quality!!\n",
      "Tastes great and keeps me full for a few hours\n",
      "This is delicious and fills me up.\n",
      "I'll give it 5 stars, because it does what I need it to. This is far and away the cheapest protein meal replacement powder out there (calories per dollar). FYI: I'm not out-of-shape or using this to lose weight, it's just a meal replacement/healthier option for me. Below are pros/cons:Pros:-tastes OK-cheap-works well as a meal replacement (I drink it at the gym in the AM, and might start using it to replace lunch). I have two servings, and I don't really get hungry. As someone who doesn't do a great job of picking out the healthiest food everyday, that's important for me-portable. I drink this for breakfast @ the gymCons:-smells like musty socks if you don't clean it out right away after using.-seriously, that smell is full-bodied and nastyAll-in-all, the best, cheap meal replacement out there\n",
      "I like it, I wish I knew more recipes for it. Maybe I can Google it, or pintrest it... I don't know. I thought it was going to taste gross but it doesn't. The can is huge which is plus!!!\n",
      "So yum, so easy to make and so satisfying. I make it with plenty of ice and chocolate rice milk. Its good if you add some frozen banana too.\n",
      "Tastes awful. Wish I could return.\n",
      "Great Taste.\n",
      "I love this product\n",
      "In my opinion, this is the best of the reasonably-priced OTC breakfast and/or single-meal diet drinks.  I jazz it up with a teaspoon or so of ground psyllium, and a couple teaspoons of protein powder.  In opposition to the directions I find it better to add dry ingredients after I've poured the required 8 ounces of non-fat milk.  After stirring briskly, I top my tall glass off with iced coffee or a spicy iced tea (like Constant Comment). DO NOTE:  The first ingredient in this drink powder IS sugar -- not the happiest of possibilities.\n",
      "I know this product has been around a long time- but this is just awesome.Here's a recipe I have been doing in a countertop blender (Hamilton Beach 8oz size I think, average glass size)I fill the blender 3/4 full with regular almond milk.1 banana2-3 ice cubes2 tbsp of creamy organic peanut butter1tsp organic honey1 scoop of the Slim Fast powder as directed on the container.I combine this with 1 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GKSBZLE?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1 in the morning and I am good until late afternoon! No cravings, no starvation, no shakiness- just the feeling of being satisfied and energized throughout the day.These shakes allowed me to cut my regular calorie intake from 2500+ calories a day to 1200 or less depending what I am in the mood for. In the 2 weeks I have been using this product I have lost about 8-10lbs which is pretty cool since I am not starving myself to death to slim down a little bit and has given me the energy to increase my exercise and to not be so obese anymore! Pretty great stuff- I will continue to order.\n",
      "Tastes like a real chocolate milkshake if you blend it with fat free milk and few cubes of ice (don't put too much though - maybe 4 cubes). Very tasty. I can't say it keeps me full very long but holds me up for a good 2.5-3 hours. Better than I expected in every sense.\n",
      "Great replacement meal and it TASTES GREAT! Fills me up for a few hours.\n",
      "I like the taste of this and when used as a meal replacement with 2 other sensible meals and an exercise plan, this helped me to lose some weight.  I will continue to use this until I lose about 10 pounds, therefore, will purchase again.  I am currently down about 5 pounds.  This had good flavor especially when mixed in a blender with a frozen banana.\n",
      "Looks like there are already plenty of reviews, but I'll add my 2 cents.  I've used Slimfast for years to help lose weight and also to keep my weight down.  I use it only for breakfast and I make a smoothie out of it.  Instead of 1 cup milk, I use 1/2 cup Odwalla Superfood and 1/2 cup vanilla Silk (Almond milk also works).  I blend this with 2 cups of frozen sliced strawberries and it turns into a thick smoothie.  This helps me to drink it slower and is more satisfying.  It keeps me full for at least 4 hours and it's only 325 calories!  Other frozen fruit can be substituted.\n",
      "Love having a shake to start the day.  Really hard to find in stores.\n",
      "Product was fine, price was way to high!\n",
      "I love the taste of the Chocolate Royale Slim Fast. It satisfies my chocolate cravings like no product has...and believe me i have tried many a protein powder or meal replacement shake.I mix it with silk unsweetend almond milk (30 cals) and therefore a satisfying shake for me only totals 140 calories in total.For an extra special treat I add some peanut butter and chia seeds...Yum (PS: I use a blender not a shaker cup)\n",
      "its ok. dont expect much out of it.\n",
      "This mix is very difficult to completely dissolve. I endedup using my ninja to make the consistency drinkable\n",
      "The reason I gave 4 stars because, I subscribed it as monthly deliver, Amazon shipped to me another similar product. However, it tastes great when I combine it with rice milk.\n",
      "Great value. Tastes good.\n",
      "Taste good and also kicks hunger in the butt\n",
      "This tastes absolutely delicious! I like mixing it with milk, banana and chia seeds. It keeps me full without the bloating. It tastes just like dessert, but it takes the place of a meal - incredible!\n",
      "not good\n",
      "I've always been a fan of slim fast. It's easy to do, saves time in the kitchen and tastes great. It stops me from grazing during the day, except on fruit and the slim fast chocolate bars. It's unfortunate that just after I started using it, BJ's stopped carrying it. So glad i'm able to purchase it on Amazon and in the large container as well.I reordered this product a second time and was disappointed to see that the price had doubled. Amazon honored the original price, which was  really nice, the i discovered BJ's started carrying it again for $11.99, $5 less than the original price online. It's a great product, tastes great and i'm still losing weight.\n",
      "It works if used as directed and tastes good albeit very rich.\n",
      "This Stuff Really does Controls your Hunger It's Weird\n",
      "The perfect go-to breakfast. Ice, milk and a scoop of slim fast into the blender. 2 minutes and you are out the door.\n",
      "I'm on NutriSystem and didn't want to purchase their shakes any longer for $45 for 7 shakes.  I think I paid about $23 for Slim Fast which makes 24 shakes and tastes just as good.  Adding a banana is my preference.\n",
      "Wonderful! Fast shipping!\n",
      "Got this to help with my weight loss journey. It tastes delicious! Plan on getting more tins. Satisfied my hunger for just over 3 hours so that's good. It made the milk so rich and creamy was so satisfied when I was done. It also has some sugar but I have a sweet tooth so it works for me, maybe u can use a lil less of the mix to cut back on tje sugar. My only problem is that it contains aspartame which is not good for u.\n",
      "Works well, as advertised.\n",
      "I love this stuff. I mix it with water in stead of milk because I hate milk and it still tastes great.\n",
      "Avg quick shake got it for on the run. Not happy it has aspartame... But aspartame is GRAS (generally recognized as safe) would not use regularly.Just thought I'd throw it out there People on special diets which may require more protein, such as renal patients getting dialysis,  avoid these type of products. Lots of phosphate additives, which are 100% absorbed. This is loaded with additives= no beuno.\n",
      "Bought this from Wal-Mart today. I had it for breakfast. I was full for a good while. I love the taste. I bought it along with a genuine blender bottle. I added one scoop some ice and day free milk and shook it real good and it was delicious. I plan on using this once or twice a day for meal replacement. Love the taste.\n",
      "This keeps me full for a meal, and tastes good at the same time. Sometimes I add black coffee to make it more of a chocolate coffee type of treat for breakfast or after I work out.\n",
      "Great taste, must exercise as well to lose weight.\n",
      "Item was shipped out in about a week. Packing was good.Item was not as described in picture. The can is almost completely white. The taste is NOT the same. You have to use 2 scoops instead of one. It's not as sweet. I called SF to find out what was going on. They said they are going through a change and the product will NOT be on the shelves for awhile.  I paid $28.09 for this can and it's kind of a rip off to me because you have to use double scoops.Other than that good luck.\n",
      "The meal replacement shake was pretty good. I mixed it with different fruits (bananas, pineapple, and strawberries) and it was delicious! Add a spoonful of natural peanut butter and it'll taste like a Reese's cup!\n",
      "Great value! Great taste.\n",
      "love it i fell great and it taste amazing\n",
      "Taste great and filling! Opposite of Miller Lite commercials which is less filling. lol  No seriously this shake mix tastes great and I mix it with Almond milk which makes it that much more filling!\n",
      "I have been drinking this for years and love it, but I will no more! The price has skyrocketed!!!! What is going on??????\n",
      "I was hesitant to buy the powder as I'm usually short on time and also because the premixed bottles are perfectly portioned so that you don't screw it up and have it tasting funny. After reading reviews of this product online and getting excellent ideas...mixing with ice in the blender was AMAZING...I am thrilled I bought the powder mix. I will be buying again and again!\n",
      "Chalky, icky tasting weight loss supplement.\n",
      "I LOVE drinking the chocolate royale slim fast! I normally put it in a blender with skim milk, some ice and a half of a banana. It's so good, just like a chocolate covered banana. Yum(:\n",
      "Excellent buy.  Cannot get this size in stores.  Great taste.\n",
      "I love this stuff. the directions say to mix with skim milk, but I mix it with water and it still tastes great with even less calories.\n",
      "We freeze ½ milk in ice cube trays, in the morning add another ½ milk and the Slim Fast powder to make chocolate milk shades for breakfast. Sounds weird, but it helps all of us to get some fiber and not consume as many calories as we would do otherwise. It started when our son was really young and he was on Miralax -- it worked better and we didn't have any compliance issues.\n",
      "But the price doubled in one month... I don't love it that much, so I'll keep checking in for a price drop.\n",
      "Too many carbs!\n",
      "I like the taste and it wasn't hard to work into a schedule. Well worth the price.\n",
      "It's good! It tastes like a rich chocolate milk. It gave me really bad gas! Once I am done breastfeeding, I will pick it back up and go by the 3-2-1 recommendation!\n",
      "Perfect for breakfast. I like to mix with a cup of coffee, nonfat milk, ice and take some vitamins. It's a nice way to get all your daily maintenance done first thing and then not worry about it later in the day.I wouldn't say it is filling, but it definitely takes the edge off hunger in the afternoon to avoid over-consuming lunch. I don't like to eat breakfast in the morning, but I can manage drinking 8-16oz of this on a regular basis. Win.\n",
      "Taste great.\n",
      "Tastes like a milkshake. Good stuff.\n",
      "taste is okay, but settles unless you mix constantly.\n",
      "good buy\n",
      "Don't really see any results but tastes amazing\n",
      "Tastes good and helps with the sweet-tooth craving. I use it in almond milk as a low calorie meal replacement or snack.\n",
      "I don't use this to lose weight, but drink it in the morning when I am in too much of a rush to make breakfast. I mix with unsweetened almond milk and it is very tasty, tastes like Nesquick chocolate milk. Keeps me full for a pretty good period of time too. Like many protein/diet shakes, it is kind of hard to mix completely with a spoon in a glass, I recommend using a Blender Bottle.\n",
      "I mix this with almond milk and use it as a meal replacement. The viscosity of the almond milk makes it taste so much more amazing than regular milk or water. I use my blender bottle and it mixes it perfectly. I will be ordering the strawberry and vanilla too for my long term regiment.\n",
      "Biggest can I have ever scene. Because of size, price is good.\n",
      "Taste like chocolate milk. So delicious. Does it work? I'm not sure. I have not seen any result yet and I feel full for only an hour or two at most. I bought this product as a protein shake but once again I'm not sure if it's doing its job. Still taste good though so I'm not mad. I would absolutely recommend this.\n",
      "This is hands down the best tasting diet food I've had. I mixed it with chocolate soy milk (didn't have the recommended skim milk around) and YUM. It was a thick chocolate shake that even my boyfriend admitted was good. I was full for several hours after. I still have not spent enough time on the diet to know if it works though.\n",
      "Tastes awesome and I really don't get hungry for hours after I drink this!\n",
      "Not saying this has helped me lose any weight as I am unsure at the moment since I need to quit drinking it with 2% and start using soy instead. HOWEVER.I work out in the wee hours of the morning and then come home and drink this to start my day. If you notice on the back of the can, this product does not have as much sugar as other brands do and even the shakes that they sell in the cans. This is the better version of slimfast for you. The taste, people are complaining of it tasting like chemicals, there are vitamins in this product that maybe your not used to the taste of but honestly in my opinion I must just be used to them and not mind the taste.I will update later on about if this helps me or not but as of right now I shall give it five stars. As I follow my diet if I notice this stuff making me gain instead of lose the lowest I would go is three stars as it still tastes good to me.\n",
      "Get a bullet blender or the like, one scoop of this , 2-3 pieces of ice, skim milk (1 or 2% is fine) , small scoop of peanut butter and half a banana (optional) and you have an amazing shake smoothy.\n",
      "This has always been my go to diet product for years. I love the flavor and how filling it is. Im not much a morning person and this is too easy, just throw it all in a smoothie blender and I drink it while I take my shower in the morning and getting ready for my day. I will continue to purchase it here because the price is awesome. And yes it does work!\n",
      "I was fat before, now I'm thin. I'd call that a win.\n",
      "IT CONTAINS ASPARTAME!!!!!!\n",
      "tasty diet aid\n",
      "Somewhat filling even though I add oatmeal for my morning shake.\n",
      "I really love the taste of this. I don't follow the slimfast diet at all so I can't comment on weight loss, but I have it at night when I'm craving chocolate. This stops me from eating a large bowl of ice cream or oreos.\n",
      "Good price.  Can't seem to buy the large containers locally anymore.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Great taste. Not chalky or gritty like alot of other brands.\n",
      "I use it because it is cheaper than them thar bottle thangs.\n",
      "I use this with water only and its pretty filling for me. I have this as a meal replacement  for lunch. I only use 1 scoop. It actually lasted me more than 3 months.\n",
      "Great and on time.\n",
      "I drink mine with 2% milk blended for a couple seconds. Nice and frothy. Does a good job as a \"filler\" meal or when you are having a snack attack.\n",
      "Not someone who eats breakfast in the morning so yes it does the trick. Also, it helps keep me going for hours.\n",
      "This product is delicious and makes wonderful shakes.  It doesn't even seem like you are on a diet.  Ready to order some more....\n",
      "great stuff\n",
      "Love the taste.\n",
      "I am not on the slim fast program but would use this as a breakfast/meal replacement at times.  The taste is good and it would mix quickly in a shaker bottle.  I would mix it a scoop with rice milk for a lower calorie \"meal\".  It's probably fine for an occasion but I couldn't imagine drinking more than once a day.\n",
      "It's good, but more of a dark chocolate flavor (not very sweet tasting).  My personal favorite is the \"creamy chocolate\".  I fill a glass with unsweetened almond milk or 60% sweetened almond milk with 40% water.  Then just mix in a scoop of the \"creamy chocolate\" and it tastes like a chocolate desert drink.  I also like to mix the creamy chocolate in the blender with bananas and blueberries/strawberries and almond milk...\n",
      "Good deal\n",
      "This is my favorite flavor but can't find it where I live. Great price as well!\n",
      "I absolutely love this chocolate flavor. It is delicious simply because it tastes like chocolate milk. I haven't seen a bunch of weight loss yet because I just started, but with exercise and one shake in the morning, a light but filling lunch and another shake for dinner and the pounds will shed.\n",
      "JUMBO SIZE GREAT. THEY DONT SELL IT AT WALGREEN OR CVS\n",
      "Nice large size.\n",
      "Im a slimfast junkie, been using it a long time and its just as good if not better than the more expensive shakes\n",
      "Only lasts for 2 hours for me. cannot be considered as a meal replacement, more like a snack replacement\n",
      "I am a long time fan of slim fast products. Especially the chocolate. I do have a little bit of a hard time with the powder not cramping up with the milk. But it's well worth the value of getting the powder verses that already made. I also get it through Amazon subscribe and save and it's nice to save that extra 15%.\n",
      "love the taste of this and its hard to find where I live\n",
      "awesome product and easy energy on the run\n",
      "delicious and priced fairly\n",
      "Buying this 34 serving big container was a way better deal than buying the little 12 serving containers at the grocery store.  I mix it with milk and drink it half way between breakfast and lunch, which keeps me from getting hungry before lunch time at work.\n",
      "Mixed this stuff with milk and soy milk and think that it tastes great either way. Would recommend.\n",
      "I love Slimfast to use for breakfast shakes instead of eating a big breakfast. It tastes great if you add a little peanut butter to the blender. Once I noticed it contains Aspartame that's when I stopped drinking it though. Hoping they'll find a way to not include aspartame in their mix.\n",
      "Tasty Shake for appetite control\n",
      "This flavor it yummy but it didn't slim me as fast as I would like. Turns out you should eat better AND exercise who would have thought?!\n",
      "Very tasty and thick. I like it a lot. I haven't lost much weight yet but I only have 10 lbs to lose so we will see.\n",
      "I have been using this for about 3 weeks now. I started off with having one in the morning for breakfast (along with eating an apple), every day; then on the days that I have off of work, I would have two (for breakfast and lunch, usually accompanied by an apple or banana & one hard-boiled egg). During my weekends, I would  only have one and I strayed from my diet that I am currently on because hey, its the weekend! BUT, In the three weeks that I have used this, it has helped me break through that brick wall that I kept hitting (I was fluctuating between having lost 23.5 and 25 pounds for a good three weeks even though I kept trying different alterations to my diet that turned out unsuccessful), and it helped me lose over 5 pounds in those three weeks, so now I am officially down 30lbs. I recommend this product if you can get into the routine of using it consistently, but it is definitely not a miracle worker all on its own. I have lost my weight through just dieting, no exercise (YET), but I would recommend this only to be used to substitute one meal a day to start off with, and then move on to two if you feel like you really want to/need to. It tastes just like chocolate milk to me, so I love it! I don't blend it, so sometimes I still have the residue (or chunks of residue) lining my cup or at the bottom of it, but I feel like if I actually used a blender, that would go away.When I first received this, the canister full of powder did come damaged (it was leaking in the box when I opened it), but I called Amazon and they sent me a new one right away with no issues at all. That is the only annoying thing that I experienced about this product. Other than that, everything about it has definitely been worth the money.\n",
      "The Royal tastes the best compared to the others. Plus the price is way better then buying at the store.\n",
      "Understanding that this isn't an actual health food supplement, it's good stuff.  Cheap, easy, mixes well, and flavor is solid.  If you use milk or some kind of rice/almond milk substitute you're basically getting glorified chocolate milk, but a little better for you.\n",
      "Slimfast has been my shake for 23 years. And they're still so yummy! If you follow their plan, you will stay slim!\n",
      "Tastes great, Easy And I am getting down to my goal weight!\n",
      "I was very pleased to find the bigger containers!!\n",
      "This is getting hard to find in grocery stores.  It's also a larger can than normal.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.\n",
      "Great taste\n",
      "Great price. Less expensive than at the grocery store. I buy about one a month. Goes great with unflavored almond milk, by the way.\n",
      "Tastes yummy and keeps me satisfied for breakfast and lunch.\n",
      "Tastes good, and helps lose weight - I lost five pounds with it,and am taking t once a day to keep excess weight off.\n",
      "Came in A1 condition.\n",
      "love this and will order more\n",
      "This is a staple in my diet. Very chocolate-y! Better than Milk Chocolate flavor.\n",
      "...It's ok. As far as flavor goes, I thought this tasted very good. Almost like Carnation Instant Breakfast but not quite. However for meal replacement, no way. I took this for several days and I was stomach grumble hungry an hour later. I'm jealous of those it kept satisfied for 4 hours. I'm still on the hunt for said shake.\n",
      "I'm not a big chocolate fan but this is yummy! Definitely made me feel more motivated to work out and kept me satisfied for a bit.\n",
      "Works like a charm\n",
      "I had been drinking the generic King Soopers brand Slim Rite, and decided to try the real stuff. I hated it! It is has a really unpleasant strange after taste. I tried it several times as a meal replacement and before/after workout pickerup.  I originally had ordered the subscription to be delivered monthly and the full can is still in my cupboard. The generic brand actually tastes a thousand times better!\n",
      "I keep a slim fast shake in the refridgerator at all times.  Just a couple of drinks when I am getting hungry between meals controls my hunger.  This product works best when you put the powder in your shaker first, then milk and shake vigorously to break up any lumps in the powder.  Each time you drink the reserved shake, you will need to shake well.\n",
      "Most easy way to keep my breakfast supply.  It just shows up at my door.  I love it and I think the slim fast is delicious.  Add a banana in the blender when you make it/  Terrific!\n",
      "Works fine, once you get started. Great for the morning when you don't have time for breakfast\n",
      "Doesn't taste as good as the premixed stuff\n",
      "I just love the taste of Slim Fast shakes! They are a great meal replacement or even dessert.\n",
      "This really is a tasty satisfying drink mix. Thick, rich and such an easy meal.I know you can easily lose weight if one just drinks these, and cut back on other food intake.Quick Shipping,Great Deal\n",
      "great\n",
      "Well, who wouldn't like a chocolate milkshake after swimming and rowing? And who doesn't mind loosing a pound each month?\n",
      "Unfortunately, it only has 2g of protein if used with water, and of coarse, it says 10g of protein with out mentioning you need to mix with milk to get the 8 extra grams, along with the 100 calories or so. So I just mix this with protein powder, I do not mind too much, but if you are seeking protein without a ton of calories, this is not the best fit.\n",
      "Arrived before ETA.  Hopefully will help with weight loss.\n",
      "Great tasting - good way to get added nutrition. Amazon has the best price!\n",
      "Great price!  Arrived in good condition.\n",
      "For those wondering if this is a good price...Walmart sells the 14-shake can for $6.88. Walmart doesn't sell the large 34-shake can, but a little simple math works out the Walmart 'cost' of 34 shakes to be $16.70.Amazon sells the 34-shake can for $16.99 (with free shipping). Once I factor in the cost of the gas it would take to drive to Walmart, the Amazon price works out to be a better deal. And the cost of not having to go to Walmart? Priceless.I personally like these shakes. If you're expecting a chocolate milkshake, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you look at it as a protein shake (rather than a dessert), the taste is actually pretty good.I recently bought this after I had a crown start throbbing, making it impossible to chew on one side, and it was going to take me a while to save up the money for the large dental bill to fix it. I had to go on the soft/squishy food diet (scrambled eggs, yogurt, etc.) because chewing was a nightmare, and I added meal replacement shakes just because liquid meals were the least painful way to get a little nutrition. I found that one shake did actually keep me feeling full for several hours.I have no idea if this works for weight loss, but as a meal replacement it worked great for me.\n",
      "Okay, haven't used it much. I am not using it for weight loss so not following the plan.  After months, still have most of the can.  Use it mostly when I don't have time to eat a regular meal and take it in the car when I know I might miss breakfast and have a late lunch.  Put in blender with some almond milk and ice cubes and make a smoothie and it tastes okay\n",
      "didn't work for me even with biking everyday finished the whole tin only lost about 5 pounds in 2.5 weeks\n",
      "Wait...This stuff is actually good for you?!?! Taste amazing!!!! I used this for my pre-op gastric bypass and i lost 50lbs.\n",
      "This product is very fulfilling and easy to make. I use it with a blender bottle and run out the door.\n",
      "Large size is great. The market always seems to be sold out & they don't carry this large size which is more cost effective.\n",
      "Very pleased with purchase.\n",
      "I put my milk in the freezer and take it our 18 hours before I use it and mix it in the blender with my slim fast powder and it is like a milk shake which is better for you.\n",
      "I'm not on any diet. I use this stuff top replace a nasty  shake with no telling what is in the thing.I have a pretty good idea what I'm drinking with this stuff...., I think.\n",
      "...but it doesn't fill me up enough. The directions say to use with skim milk. But even when I make it with whole milk, I'm still hungry after this shake (unlike other protein shakes). If you look at the ingredients you can see this isn't the healthiest shake going (a bit of sugar) but I'd take the sugar over artificial sweeteners.\n",
      "Love it lost over 5 pounds in one week, you are not hungry at all and taste great buy this!!\n",
      "Tended to make me feel bloated. But the taste and richness is Great. Going to try it again with a different meal plan.\n",
      "I use this as a filler and not necessarily as a diet item.  It fits my busy schedule and when I am short of time.The new stuff in the bright red cans seems to dissolve very easily compared to the old stuff.I love it, and will continue to use it as I have in years past.  It fits my needs.... and tastes quite good.\n",
      "The perfect weight-loss aid. It satisfies hunger as it substitutes for a meal, and it also satisfies my chocolate cravings. Tastes just like a milkshake!\n",
      "it is very filling. I use the product as a breakfast, and do not feel hungry for four or five hours.\n",
      "I tried this stuff for about a week, mixing it with unsweetened almond milk. I took it only once a day in conjunction with regular exercise. Although it definitely tastes great, I really don't think it does much. It makes me full for maybe an hour so I can't really see changing another regular meal out for one of these shakes. I'll continue to use it until it runs out but really don't see myself buying it again.\n",
      "Back in the 80's I used this in high school and college to lose some weight.  I remember it tasted great and worked so decided to order it.  When I received my big can of Slim Fast I turned it around to look at the ingredients.  The first ingredient is SUGAR!  Third ingredient is SUNFLOWER OIL.  It still tastes yummy.  However I was hungry shortly after drinking.  Bummed to have wasted money on this old fashioned product.\n",
      "I love this stuff, mixes well and is quite thick. Rich and chocolatey, a little guilty pleasure of mine. I will be buying this again.\n",
      "this product is awesome..high quality !it has great taste and quality.it is also very helpful. I will re-buy it.!\n",
      "Love the taste for breakfast and just found this larger size at a lower cost than you can find locally.\n",
      "I love the rich flavor of Slim Fast Chocolate Royale. I mix a 1 scoop in my 28 oz blender bottle, fill with ice and water.  Shake a few times and I have an awesome, thick, vitamin filled breakfast with half the calories of a shake made with MILK.  Perfectly satisfying and the feeling of fullness lasts all morning to prevent hunger, plus I get my daily water intake.  One in the morning, one at noon and one at night.  I am losing weight and getting compliments.  I love it.  I buy the 34 size so it last longer. AWESOME product!!\n",
      "This is great with 30 Calorie Almond milk!  It has really helped me jump start my weight loss and exercise routine!\n",
      "I recently ordered two meal replacement products: Nature's Way Metabolic Reset (Chocolate) and Slim Fast Rich Chocolate Royale.Bottom line: There is no comparison. The Slim Fast product is superior to the Nature's Way product in every way. The Slim Fast product is rich, smooth, creamy, and delicious. The Nature's Way product is chalky, gritty, and nauseating. The Slim Fast product is packaged responsibly. The Nature's Way product is packaged so as to deceive and mislead and it's between 2.3 and 3.4 times as expensive as the Slim Fast depending on whether you count the milk or not.When I opened the Slim Fast can, it smelled like chocolate. When I mixed up a glass, the powder dissolved easily in cold milk. I have a little battery-powered hand mixer that I've used in the past, but I hardly needed it at all. I took a sip. It was thick, creamy, smooth, and delicious. I put it in a bottle in the frig.The next day, the Slim Fast was still smooth and creamy and delicious. It was still completely mixed. None of it had settled to the bottom. It was truly like a malt shop milk shake. I believe I will be able to get away with mixing less than a full scoop and still have a great drink.Update 05/25/14I have now used this product with whole milk, 2% milk, soy milk, almond milk, and rice milk. Each batch was 4 cups (32 oz). I couldn't tell much difference between the any of them except the almond milk, which was surprising to me, especially the rice milk. I never had them side by side, so maybe it would have been easier to differentiate that way. But just picking one up and trying it, they were all very similar and quite good. The almond milk was also good, but had a slightly different taste.I also found that I don't need nearly as much of the powder as the package recommends. I tried mixing two cups of whole milk with two scoops of powder. It was almost too thick and a little too strong. I ended up adding another cup of milk and probably could have added even a little more. I had a similar experience with the soy milk. I can probably get away with at least a third less powder.I'll probably mostly use the soy milk. It's 40% fewer calories than even 2% milk and almost as much protein, which neither the almond or rice milk have. My only concern is the very high amount of potassium.\n",
      "All I can say is that it is delicious. I mix it with either fat free milk or almond milk and it keeps me feeling full for a couple hours. I don't take it to lose weight, but for breakfast when I'm in a rush.\n",
      "I FEEL LIKE I GAINED MORE WEIGHT DRINKING IT. LOL BUT.... BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN DRINKING IT THE PROPER WAY.\n",
      "This works, used in moderation!!  I have used this as my total noon meal for a long time.  It even tastes good!\n",
      "If you price this product in a grocery store, you will see that this is the best value when comparing price to size of container.  I like Slim Fast for a quick lunch or snack.  If you don't have a good drink shaker, Amazon sells one that has a wire ball inside that mixes up the powder really well so you don't end up with lumps at the bottom.\n",
      "I CHOOSE THIS TATEING BECAUSE SLIM-FAST IS A GOOD PRODUCT. 2 SHAKES A DAY REALLY HELPS FILL YOU UP . I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TOO ANYONE THAT IS TRYING TOO LOOSE WEIGHT.\n",
      "this often takes the place of my lunch. if you do this instead of lunch and all other eating habits remain the same, you may lose weight.If you are buying it to lose weight and do not exercise you may be dreaming. Exercise does not mean working up a sweat for hours it means moving. Maybe just walking  up or down the driveway, but start moving.  It taste good.\n",
      "Got 2 for 16 bucks!\n",
      "This flavor of slim fast tastes wonderful.  It mixes easily with milk and truly reduces my hunger cravings.  I use it as a breakfast replacement.\n",
      "Great product i used it before and worked great and was delivered very very Fast... I love it:) if you follow the recommendations this product works like magic\n",
      "I can't attest to how well it works, but the taste is fantastic. I mix it with 8oz of chocolate soy milk and love it! I don't normally eat breakfast, so this is something pleasant that I can drink to jump start my metabolism in the morning.\n",
      "If I am in a hurry and need some quick energy, I stir up a Slim Fast shake with no fat milk. To make it taste like a mocha cappuccino, I add some instant coffee to it! Tastes great and ties me over until the next meal is ready.\n",
      "Hate  the canned drinks.  Love this powder mixed with dry non fat milk and crushed ice in blender.  Is more like real shake, and no canned flavor.\n",
      "(I just mentioned the large content of sugar in the vanilla shake -then I went to check this one (I got the vanilla as an add on ...)I like the taste, I think it is great -  and if you follow the slim-fast plan (and not just take the shake) it *may actually help* - I do not claim otherwise.All is fine - but hey -  if you write 10g of protein, 4g of fiber you should also write 22g of Sugars so people will know what they are getting.\n",
      "I wish you carried the French Vanilla in the large size cannister, it would be so much more economical and convenient\n",
      "This product is great in the morning for those in a rush.  Satisfies my appetite until lunch.Highly recommend for anyone.\n",
      "I COULD NOT USE ALL THE PRODUCT BECAUSE MY WIFE GETS A BYPASS BUT IN THE MEANTIME IT WAS VERY USEFUL, TASTY AND GET A STOMACH FULL SENSATION IN 15 MINUTES\n",
      "wife and I are starting our diet and this shake is a great way to get our love for chocolate with our vitamins and minerals keeps us full for along period of time....we keep buying them we lost weight and are on our 3rd can ....\n",
      "I have been searching for a high protein mix that does not make me gain weight.  My old one is discontinued after 40 years and that is disturbing to a blood disorder.\n",
      "Slim Fast has a good chocolate flavor. I add more chocolate than the instructions call for. Amazon automatic shipping is very convenient for this product.\n",
      "I will be the first to admit that this product will probably not help me lose any weight. That being said, I'm not really looking to lose weight, I'm more interested in maintaining the weight I'm currently at.However, it's a super quick VERY tasty alternative to breakfast. Let me reiterate, I think this stuff tastes fantastic. On work days, I'm so tired in the morning and end up running around like a maniac to get out of the door on time. I just throw milk, slim fast and two ice cubes into the blender, blend for a few seconds, pour it, and drink it while i'm getting ready. it helps suppress my hunger for a portion of the morning until I'm ready to have some fruit as a snack. I also sometimes drink this after a run.\n",
      "I can't miss a day without my chocolate royale  shake powder mix.  Sometimes I have 2 in a day..satisfies my hunger and my love of chocolate!  The flavor is superior to other powdered mixes.\n",
      "I used this for a few days. It tastes pretty good and gave me energy. I did lose 2 lbs. it has artificial sweeteners which I really try to avoid.\n",
      "I was so pleased to find a larger container of Slimfast on Amazon.  The best part was that it was a great price.  With our Amazon Prime it kept the price low and had it in two days!  Very pleased.\n",
      "Large canister to save money. Works well as a diet aide when used 2 x a day as a meal substitute. Rich chocolate flavor makes it easier to use if you like chocolate.\n",
      "Have used in past and very easy to use and makes fast breakfast and lasttrought the morning til lunch, Was received guickly and packaged very well.\n",
      "We love the taste, it is always quick and easy when we are running late or just in the mood for a smoothie!\n",
      "I have this for breakfast every day, been drinking this for about 15 yrs. seems like I can't get my day started without it.Satisfies me and I don't feel bloated first thing in the morning.\n",
      "I love this stuff, I've already lost 5 pounds in less than a week...5 pounds that didn't budge in 2 weeks with a low carb diet, it's weird but true! For some reason my body responds better to weight loss when I have one liquid meal a day, but here's the thing, I am eating too. For breakfast I brew up some coffee and put it in the fridge over night then I mix the coffee with the slimfast, 1 banana, 1/2 cup of raspberries, a tablespoon of natural peanut butter, and a handful of ice....yummy! You will be full with this for hours and it's only a little over 300 calories. Then I eat a healthy lunch, usually a baked potato with some meat and veggies, or a frozen meal if I'm at work, then around 3pm I drink another slimfast shake mixed with the rest of my cold coffee I brewed to give me energy for my 4pm workout, all I mix for this snack is a scoop of the powder, cold coffee and lots of ice...better than any Starbucks coffee for sure (and way less money). This completely takes away all my cravings and gives me a nice boost of energy where I work out for about 40 minutes. Then for dinner I have whatever I want within reason and around 500 calories. That's it and I am losing the weight that wasn't budging before! I couldn't be happier. Hopefully this review will help someone else if you are looking for ideas on how to use and make the shakes.\n",
      "I've used SlimFast for years!  Love it, so easy to fix my lunch which is a shake and perhaps some fruit.  Been the same weight for many years..\n",
      "So I blend this every morning with fresh fruit, ground flaxseed, honey, and either vanilla yogurt or vanilla almond milk.  Makes an excellent smoothie.  Super-healthy.  May have to order more soon!\n",
      "chocolate is our favorite. that's probably why it's the biggest, because so many like it. the mix dissolves well in kefir milk too\n",
      "It is tasty; packed with vitamins and is FAST.  I don't drink it to lose weight but I guess you could.  I drink it because to me it makes good nutrition sense.\n",
      "I LOVE THIS DRINK, I REPLACE MY BREAKFAST MEAL WITH THIS ONE EVERY MORNING AND IT TASTE DELICIOUS AND REAL CHOCOLATE.\n",
      "I mostly use this as a sweetener to mix in with other meal replacements or protein mixes. It has way too much sugar to use one its own.\n",
      "This is tasty and presumably nutritious.  If you mix it up in a glass, you will spend forever trying to get it to stop sticking to your glass.  It works better in a blender but thats more to clean.\n",
      "For me, I like a little more protein, but the wife swears by it and it appears to be helping her.  She has dropped weight, but I won't discuss it too much here.  We order two canisters at a time to save on shipping.\n",
      "--without doing any extra exercise, or much at all, in fact (I'm disabled and have a thyroid problem that caused a rapid weight gain a few months ago). I've been using it for about three months and have dropped 18 pounds! It's so great fitting back into my old clothes again.Just make sure you use a shaker of some type, like a cocktail shaker or lidded bottle, or blender to mix it up. A spoon WON'T help at all.\n",
      "I either add a banana, or add expresso coffee. It takes the place of a meal, or when I'm in need of chocolate.  Saves on calories!\n",
      "I have been using the powder form of the Slim Fast product for several years. It has always been available in this size container, but other retail stores don't seem to carry it any more. I found it at Amazon and will continue to buy it her as long as they have it available. THANKS AMAZON!\n",
      "I love this!! It taste great and helps curbs my appeitie so I don't over eat. Just follw the directions of it and you will see results :).I'm ordering another so I can have more when I run out.\n",
      "Reasonable price and I love the taste. When adding ice makes a milk shake taste.  Will definitely order again. 5 stars.\n",
      "I liked this although I am not a huge chocolate person. I would probably buy it again and just be prepared for the richness of it!\n",
      "I love Slim Fast, I love the taste, it's the best in taste of all the replacement meals I've tried. However, it has too much sugar in it. 10 grams per serving, that's a lot for a dietary product. It shouldn't be, they should find some Splenda or Stevia replacement, I don't know. I stopped using it because of it.I've tried their protein shake and it has less sugar and tastes also good. But that's the shake, the powder one also has 10 grams of sugar. I don't understand why they can reduce the sugar on the shake, but not the powder.\n",
      "It does CONTROL HUNGER!!! Tastes good, and heals your hungry stomach for more than 4 hours.But, it cannot stop your desire for food. You got to control your mind yourself~~!\n",
      "This is my favorite flavor of the slim fast powders. I drink them 2 times a day. This much larger can was a great price on amazon and was shipped to my house quickly! will keep using amazon to buy these!\n",
      "This tastes delicious and is a great drink to have in the morning when heading out from the house.  Have been able to have some success with weight loss.  It has to be combines with eating right and also excerise.  We use it more for the vitamins and when we don't have time for breakfast.  Only down side it is hard to mix together sometimes.\n",
      "I drink Slim Fast every morning at work and it keeps me full until lunch. It's delicious and I really never get tired of it. This one is a much better deal than buying the regular sized cans in stores like CVS.\n",
      "I used to drink protein shakes but these taste way better. I mix the powder with Lactaid Fat Free milk because I'm lactose intolerant. I know that Lactaid tastes a little sweeter than regular milk, so maybe that is why I like it. I drink it with a straw which also helps me avoid any gritty textures. I have to admit, I'm a big fan. My doctor told me I needed to lose 15-20 lbs, as I have a family history of high cholesterol and Type 2 Diabetes. I'm 42 years old, 5'0\" and weighed 140 lbs. I started my fitness mission a month ago and drink 2 shakes a day, eat a healthy snack (like an apple) and eat one small meal (usually at dinner). I've been working out twice a week with a personal trainer (I found a Groupon for 8 sessions) and do cardio for 30 minutes almost daily on my own. I've already lost 5 lbs., which I'm pretty happy about. I know that a person is more likely to keep the weight off if it's lost slowly, so I'm glad I didn't drop the 5 lbs. in one week (totally not healthy). I have a goal weight of 115 and hope that the shakes will help keep me at a 1200 calorie/day intake. I use Myfitnesspal to track my progress. Aside from the weight loss, the other thing I've noticed is that I don't have low blood sugar attacks any more. The shakes do keep me satiated for 4 hours and then it's usually time for another meal. I used to have low blood sugar issues all the time if I didn't snack every 2-3 hours.I'll keep you posted on my progress, but so far so good!\n",
      "I have been using Slim Fast in the 31.18 oz size for years.  I love it and have it every morning for breakfast.  The store I was getting it from stopped carry it.  Their loss-- Thanks to Amazon I can now order it from them.  Wish I had known I could get it there before.\n",
      "Slim Fast Chocolate Royale ShakeI really like the flavor. Smooth, rich, delicious. I initially ordered this product to help me lose a few extra pounds. I figured it would be pretty easy since it is a protein meal replacement. I followed the meal replacement plan faithfully but I wasn’t losing like I thought I would so I added \n",
      "Vivisani Labs Garcinia Cambogia\n",
      " for appetite suppression. Boy did that make a difference. The weight started dropping off. I lost the 15 pounds I wanted to loose and I’m so proud of myself and my new look. I recommend this combination for weight loss and appetite suppression.\n",
      "When whipped up in a blender with non fat milk it reminds me of a chocolate milkshake but thinner.  Great flavor and I do feel full after consuming.\n",
      "Very good. I drink several glasses at each meal and haven't lost any weight yet???  :-)(Actually, throw a couple of ice cubes into the blender with your milk. Makes a thick, cold \"shake.\")\n",
      "im a fat girl trying to loose weight.i have always loved ice cream.well this is a great substuite.love it.its hard to loose weight cause of my meds.but i cant gain anymore with this.and it helps me not be hungry.\n",
      "I love this stuff. I always seem to wake up with an upset stomach and drinking a shake makes sure I still get what I need for the day\n",
      "Use the Slim-Fast mix every day and could not get the large can locally at present.  It helps me keep my weight steady or helps me loose weight depending on how I use it.\n",
      "I love this! I usually bring the pre-made shakes to work with me but I always have the powder at home. I think the powder gives a much richer, creamier taste than the pre-made version. I use it with a BlenderBottle shake mixer and it works great!\n",
      "DELICIOUS!Add a few banana's in for a real treat! (Plus it keeps you fuller longer) It's only been 1 day, and I already lost 3 pounds. CRAZY RIGHT? I tried this one and the french vanilla. It's amazing.\n",
      "Tastes awesome!  Not hard to skip a meal when you get to drink something that tastes like rich chocolate milk, hot or cold!!!\n",
      "Love slim-fast. I use this powder almost every morning. And I also believe that the Chocolate Royale flavor does taste the best. Just can't do without it...... lol\n",
      "Been drinking Slim Fast for breakfast for four years, lost 65 pounds.  Local stores do not carry very often, this is convenient.\n",
      "Got mine in the mail today and tried it right away. I love it! The taste is very chocolate and creamy. Highly recommend it!\n",
      "I don't use Slim Fast often but when I do, it works for me to lose about 20 lbs. I put the mix in my blender with 6 ice cubes and its a great milkshake. It fills me up, but I always plateau at 20 lbs.\n",
      "Always arrives on time and is a product I enjoy using.  The product is always well packaged so there is never any damage during the shipping process.  My local stores do not carry this size so I always have the availabilty to what I want.\n",
      "I have used this product for years and find it easy to use and very tasty!  It fills me up for several hours.\n",
      "I love chocolate so I love this drink great taste great meal replacement. I would buy this again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Recommend to all chocolate lovers\n",
      "I fix my Slim-Fast shake by adding 1 scoop of Slim Fast Powder, 1 c. of Silk Vanilla Light Soymilk, 9 ice cubes, 1 Tbs. cocoa powder (195 calories total).  It tastes great and gives me tons of energy every morning!\n",
      "I very much enjoy Slim-Fast, the Creamy Vanilla with fruit added and the Chocolate Royale Shake. I will order again!\n",
      "This is a huge container of the Slim Fast Powder mix and super fast shipping.  I would definitely buy this product again.  I have looked and can not find this size in any stores.\n",
      "After childbirth I was having problems losing the weight. Before pregnancy I was 108lb and  gained about 70 pound while pregnant:'-(. It hasn't been a full week of drinking this shake as a replacement meal and I have lost 4 pounds. Im starting to exercise again along with this to see what results I get.\n",
      "Slim Fast is A Healthy way to Keep Your Weight in check. I Drink a Shake For Breakfast And Lunch. I also have a Balanced Dinner and All is Good. I lost 58 pounds And Now i can Maintain my current Weight. And I feel Better than ever. My Doctor is happy too. All is good.\n",
      "Sorry people. Yes, it has great taste and I really enjoy it but I feel hungry all the time. I mean, these Slim Fast products claim they make you lose weight but this is like drinking any other shake. If you only drink that all day, you lose weight. For me, it does not do it, I feel unsatisfied and thinking of food all day. After a week of this diet I had to eat a large peperoni pizza because I was going nuts. So trust me, there are other ways of losing weight, this one may work but it will drive you crazy and you will be hungry, very hungry.\n",
      "Previously I was buying this at my local big box discount club. They no longer carry it. I could not find that size anywhere in town. These shakes have been my breakfast for years. I was very happy to discover that you carry it. KUDOS!\n",
      "I like slim fast.  It is a good meal for the day if you don't work out a lot.  If you do I recommend eating a piece of peanut butter toast with it.\n",
      "i'm new in general to the shake diets, but have tried other appetite control products in the past with very little lasting success. these last few weeks have seen my waistline start to push the limits of my wardrobe, mostly because i'm subconsciously trying to keep up at the dinner table with my pregnant wife. she's supposed to be gaining weight right now, but not me. oops!enter slim fast shakes. the chocolate royale was in the lightning deals for $11.99 so i decided it was worth a try. as usual, prime shipping had it here on the second business day, in perfect condition. i'm now on day three with the shakes, and i have to say that i can already tell a difference! i'm taking a shake for breakfast and one for lunch, and i've not had the urge to snack at all until late afternoon. normally, i'm snacking on chips or candy bars or twizzlers all day at the job, but not this week! i also feel like i have more energy (especially early in the morning). placebo effect? not sure i care, as long as it continues to work.these shakes taste good too! they're not chalky or slimy or any of the nasty words i've heard used to describe them in the past. i even let my wife try one, and she nearly drank the whole thing on me. i almost look forward to them, and not because i know they're the only thing i'll be consuming until dark either. i actually enjoy them!by the time dinner rolls around, i'm definitely starving. right now, i'm probably eating enough to nearly make up for the skipped lunch, but i'm guessing that will lessen as i get used to the new routine. i haven't been using the 3 - 2 - 1 system advertised on the canister, but i may get into that if the urge to snack gets too overwhelming.for now, i will end this review. in one month, i'll come back and update my progress, and let you all know if i'm sick and tired of the shakes, or if they've changed my life for the better. wish me luck...one month later:i made it most of the way through the month on these shakes. i had to stop taking them for a couple days because i came down with a pretty nasty cold, but otherwise i was pretty regular on the shakes until i ...gave up. the shakes taste good enough, but they were not filling me up at all. past the first week, i was starving two hours after each shake. the shakes did no more to control my hunger than a plain glass of milk would do.so of course, i started snacking lightly between shakes/meals. i kept the snacks to a minimum, and i thought i was doing a pretty decent job of it. then i stepped on the scale at the 3 week mark. i gained 5 pounds! i was giving this my all for three weeks, and i ended up gaining weight instead of losing it, even after being sick in bed with a cold that kept me from eating anything for two days. i was pretty disappointed, but figured i should give it another week or so until the shake mix ran out, just to see if i could make some progress. i did not, and actually gave up on it before i finished the entire canister of mix.long story short, this attempt at a diet was an utter failure for me. i can't fully blame the product, because i did not follow the food recommendations quite as well as i should have. however, the hunger control did nothing to curb my appetite, and i ended up being just as hungry while using the shakes as i was before starting them. i'm knocking off a star because of this.oh well. it was worth a shot.\n",
      "It's an easy and healthy way to lose weight. It help me lose 20 pounds.  Also a delicious drink!  I take it for breakfast and evening meal and I can maintain my present weight.  A suggestion is to drink plenty of water which I do in the morning hours.\n",
      "At most grocery stores the small 12 1/2 oz cans are 10 bucks, it takes almost three of those to equal this 32 oz size.As for the taste Royale is the best of the many chocolate shakes I've had. As for results as long as you follow the suggestions(one in the morning one for lunch and a half decent supper you will lose weight. Add in exercise and watch lbs. shed even faster.\n",
      "Use it for a smoothie every morning.  Add a banana and ice and blend.  Sometimes a raw egg.  Very good and will get you  until lunchtime.\n",
      "After a lot of research, I bought this above all other products.  It offered good nutritional value and was more affordable.  So glad I made the decision I did.  While I'm only replacing a few lunches with these shakes, I'm already losing enough weight to wear my pants more comfortably.  I've lost 2-3 pounds per week when dedicated to having at least 3 or 4 \"shake lunches\", and I feel great for it.  Although it suggests mixing with milk, I mix with ice water to reduce even more calories.  Opinions may differ, but I still think it tastes great with a water mix!\n",
      "So far its working for me, two shakes a day and I have lost about 18 lbs in about 2.5 months.  It also taste great.\n",
      "Love the product and have used it for years.  I add veg. and fruit every morning for breakfast. Some times for lunch.\n",
      "I buy 2 at a time, I keep one at work, one on top of my fridge, and I bring a gallon of milk to work each Monday. Compared to the retail store size [9-11 oz depending...], my second purchase saved me about 33% from stores, which never seem to have this on sale. My first purchase of 2 was a steal. Seller had a $5 off any Slim-Fast! order exceeding $25, so on that purchase, my savings over retail store size closer to 45%. If you premix large batches in 1/2 or 1 gal. milk jugs and store in the fridge like I do, cut a 20 oz soda bottle off about 2\" from the top and invert into mouth of a milk jug. Soda bottle mouth perfectly fits in the mouth of a plastic milk jug, and voila, a funnel that is about 30% wider than the measuring scoop, so never a spill. Then take the \"funnel\" and plop it right back in the can with the scoop, until next time.\n",
      "I have not been able to find my favorite Shake Mix Powder in any local store.  It was great to find it on Amazon.  It was a larger size and cost less too.\n",
      "For some reason, retailers do not maintain adequate inventory. (Either the product sells too fast to keep on the shelves or they don't order enough often enough). For whatever reason, the supply is inadequate. By buying from Amazon, we now have enough on our shelves to keep from having to drive around.Product is great, taste great and provides the protein in a flavorable way.\n",
      "My first pregnancy was easy.  6 weeks post birth I was in my old jeans and only had 2 lbs hanging on that I wanted gone.Second pregnancy was terrible.  40 lbs of extra weight that just didn't want to leave so after 6 months I tried this.  So I started up a small work out at Zumba 2 days a week for an hour and replaced my breakfast with slimfast.  I changed a bit of what I ate more in portion size than what I ate and 9 months later I was down to my old weight.  Now I am 2 months post my third child and down to 15 lbs above my old weight and slimfast is helping me once again.  It works for me and gives me a bit of a chocolate 'fix' for my morning meal.  Can't complain about that!\n",
      "I have used this product for several years when I needed to drop a few pounds. It has always worked for me. I restrict the usage to around 60 days each time just because some change is needed at the time. I am nearly ready to start again.\n",
      "Just adding my two cents to the other reviewers who use, enjoy, and appreciate this product. I've used this Slim Fast product about 5 times a week for 7 months and still enjoy the taste. I usually keep it simple: a scoop mixed with about a cup of 2% milk, maybe and add a banana on the side. To get wild, I use the blender and blend it with ice, sometimes with a tablespoon of peanut butter or a few drops of vanilla or mint extract. OK, so I'm not into complicated smoothies, but that's why this works so well for me. The taste is chocolatey and smooth. It is easy to mix, costs less than the bottled stuff (and tastes better!) and lends itself well to doctoring up when I feel like it..or not.I don't use it only for breakfast, though. I have used this as a quick snack in the afternoon when I needed something to tide me over for a late, light supper or when I just did not feel like eating much in the evening.But, any weight loss regimen needs exercise. Along with the shake, I've been using my elliptical. I find that after I drink my shake and spend an hour checking email and other stuff, I feel OK to get on the machine.  The shake fills me up, but I don't feel stuffed, even when adding a banana, and it keeps the hunger away for at least 3 hours. If you plan to walk, run, or hit the gym, and need a light meal, this might work well for you.I've tried a couple of other protein shakes and still like Slim Fast the best- mainly because of the taste. I really do look forward to drinking this (I like chocolate milk!) and the flavor is rich. I nearly always use a spoon (less to wash than a blender or a blender cup) and have little problem with the mix sticking to the side- I just stir it using the side of the spoon and it mixes up just fine.So, if you are looking for a protein shake, Slim Fast is a great option. You can find other products that cost more, that tout yard-long lists of nutrients, that appeal to gym rats, or claim medical benefits, but I don't think you will find anything that gives you as a good a value and taste as Slim Fast.\n",
      "I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT IN A SMOOTHIE FOR MANY YEARS NOW.  THE ONLY PLACE I CAN PURCHASE THIS LARGER CAN IS AT SAM'S WAREHOUSE WHICH IS QUITE FAR FROM ME, SO BUYING FROM AMAZON AND DELIVERED BY MAIL IS A LOT MORE CONVENIENT FOR ME, AS LONG AS THE PRICE DOESN'T CHANGE.  IF IT CHANGES, I KNOW LONGER WILL GET IT BY MAIL.\n",
      "It's tasty, but it doesn't really keep me full for long though. I like adding peanut butter to it to make it thicker and for some added protein.\n",
      "I used this for my breakfast before I go to work. It's quick and good. If I am busy all morning I don't feel hungry til lunch. Great!\n",
      "I know this may not have the best nutrition of all the weight loss shakes and powders, but it tastes the best and it is working for me.  I only use it for breakfast, blended with frozen blueberries and 2 handfuls of spinach.  This price is the best.\n",
      "This is probably the best tasting powder drink mix I've ever had. Tastes like a creamy milkshake after you mix it well!\n",
      "Even better than their chocolate malt! I love making this in the mornings - very delicious and always leaves me satisfied. :)\n",
      "Been buying the smaller size for over 30 years, so happy that came up this larger size at a great price!  I drink this every morning and I feel full all day!!\n",
      "Slim Fast is the only thing that's ever helped me lose weight.  This newer formula of shake mixes up really smoothly.  I would recommend a mixing bottle with a ball or whatever inside.  Chocolate Royale is MUCH better than milk chocolate!\n",
      "If you have ever had slim fast before, this is not something new.  It has a very good chocolate taste.  I prefer the Chocolate Royale over the Milk Chocolate.  I am cutting milk mostly out of my diet so I did make it with water, which is against the recommendations, but it still tasted good and I did not get hungry until several hours later.\n",
      "I don't have any problem with the drink, it certainly tastes a lot better than it did coming out of the cans! However, you can buy it for $3 less at Sams... :-/\n",
      "Slim-fast has a great chocolate taste, and it fills you up so you can consume fewer calories to lose weight.\n",
      "Good replacement for a breakfast or lunch meal when dieting and have a busy day.  Diabetic excange (mixed with 8 oz skim milk) equals: 2 Carbs, 1-1/2 Protein and 1 fat.  It would be wonderful if it can in \"sugar free\" but I have explored the internet and apparently sugar free no longer exist.  I look the Royale Chocolate Mix Powder better that the bottled varity and could only find it on \"Amazon.com\".  Hope they continue to sell it!!!\n",
      "love it! the slim-fast came fresh and it was just what i wanted. i have it for breakfast every morning\n",
      "Love this for busy mornings and light lunches.  Arrived quickly and was priced well!  Weight loss journey now under way!\n",
      "Helps ease hunger. Great for a quick way to replace a meal on the go, stir in milk. I also make various smoothies with this powder, my favorite being this powder, milk, a scoop of peanut butter, a frozen banana and as many ice cubes as you desire mixed in a blender. Yum!\n",
      "I love this slim fast.  Every morning I throw some fiber, 8 ounces of light organic soy milk, slim fast and an ice cube in my blender and drink it along with taking my vitamins.  It tastes great and is much easier to prepare than a normal breakfast and has less calories than most other breakfast choices.  The price is great and the speed of delivery by Amazon was great as usual.  I highly recommend this product!\n",
      "I've been drinking this as a dinner replacement with fruits blended in as well.This is a great alternative for people who are trying to learn how to eat smaller dinners, for people who work out, people who want to lose weight, and people who can benefit from all of the vitamins and protein!\n",
      "This flavor is by far my favorite so I am glad they make it in the giant tub. It's richer than the milk chocolate. I mix mine with light soymilk or soy latte (caffeine). I also like to add in ice and frozen fruit like strawberries or half a banana. This makes an easy meal full of nutrition and can help you keep on track with your diet or you can follow their plan. I am using slimfast for weight loss and am losing a pound a week without even following the plan to the dime. I have used it before and lost 12lbs!\n",
      "It mixes readily with skim mild.  Taste good.  It keeps hunger stayed for at least 4 hours for me.  The packaging was good also.  No dents for breaks in the contents.  It arrived by promised date.\n",
      "My discipline is lacking to do what I need to do, and the product can't act as my analyst. filler words,...\n",
      "I enjoy slim fast choc royale shake every am with a banana.  Refreshing and does the job of a quickhealthy breakfast.\n",
      "Slim Fast Chocolate Royale Shake Mix Powder is delicious, easy to prepare, filling, price is reasonable and I have used it approximately 10 years..\n",
      "First off the flavor is heavenly.I typically keep some on hand just to throw in my coffee on days when I know I won't be able to have a full breakfast. It keeps me full for around a good three hours.I did try to the whole slim fast 3-2-1 plan and lost a good amount of weight. However the plan pretty much all sweets! While it works because it involves a low calorie intake, there is so much sugar.It is easy enough to watch your portions and calories and still meet a minimum while eating real food that isn't so sugary and processed.But like I said this is great to have on hand for those busy mornings and tastes great.Plus it fills you up more than just adding cream or sugar would for about the same caloric cost.\n",
      "So I've only made a few shakes with it but I just have to say that it's so delicious! I never even write reviews on here but this flavor is fabulous! I just mix it with skim milk and bam! It's great, definitely recommend.\n",
      "I've always been a fan of the slim fast products. I like this flavor, but when I looked at the nutrition label, it's mainly carbs and sugar, yes it has vitamins, but if you don't mix it with milk, you only get 2g of protein or so. I actually have also been using Dymatize's ISO protein powder, it's only 100cal, 2gcarbs, 23gprotein, and no sugar. It's also a lot cheaper, you can get a 5 pound container for about $50. Slim fast has also increased their prices and decreased the portion sizes for some of the products. If you're having a chocolate craving then yes, you should try this, because it's better than a candy bar, but I'd go with a protein shake if you're trying to get healthy.\n",
      "I really love it.  It really works, it tastes good, & it is so easy to use. If you try it, you'll like it!\n",

      "The most economical way I have found to lose weight if you follow the directions.  I have been successful in the past with having weight loss with this product, but sometimes I substitute it for a meal or a snack just because I like the taste and believe it's a healthy substitute for other less healthful foods.\n",
      "Old reliable, tastes great and helps me maintain my weight.  I have been using this product for many years.  Thanks.\n",
      "Love the product and use it daily!  I would recommend this product to anyone that wishes to maintain or lose weight.\n",
      "I love this stuff!!! It tastes great so it's really easy to stick to 2 shakes a day and one meal. YUM!!!!\n",
      "Arrives on time, every time! My whole family loves this stuff so we keep a constant supply in the house.\n",
      "Good price, fast shipping, well packaged. Would buy from again. The chocolate flavor is pretty thick when mixed with milk (I use skim milk).\n",
      "I love the taste of this shake.  My only complaint is that other flavors are not also available in the 31.18 oz size.\n",
      "I recently started the Slim-fast routine, and I have to say I love the Chocolate Royale shake mix.  My preferred shake recipe is as follows:1 cup skim milk1 tablespoon creamy, natural peanut butter1 scoop powderabout 1/4 cup nonfat vanilla greek yogurt (I use half of an individual container)1 1/4 cup iceBlend all of the above in blender, and voila!  :o)Tastes EXACTLY like a chocolate peanut butter ice cream shake.  SO GOOD!  Enjoy!  :o)\n",
      "I really like the slim fast powder, especialy the chocolate. I like this alot better than the bottles you can buy! Has a much better taste. Followed it mostly for three weeks and lost 13 lbs! Can't beat that!\n",
      "excellent product and quality.  Securely packed and well priced.. . . . . . . . . . . .\n",
      "After using this for several months now, I can say that its not very effective. It tastes good and makes you want to feel good that you are making a difference to your body, but in a few hours, you wil be hungry again.3-stars for the price, taste and proteins. Other than that, not recommended.\n",
      "This was a very good value compared to buying the smaller size at Walmart. The kids like this as a quick snack or breakfast when they don't have time.\n",
      "I have a Slim Fast shake every morning for breakfast...one scoop in 12 oz of milk instead of the 8 oz the directions call for. A little more milk makes for a shake that is easy to drink. It tastes very good and keeps me full for 4 hours. I appreciate the Subscribe and Save option. A canister this large is very hard to find in the grocery store.\n",
      "I've been using these shakes on and off for six years. Like others, I switched to the mix powder when the ready-to-drink shakes went from 12 ounces to 10 ounces. The shake tastes fine with just the powder and milk. But adding a tablespoon of peanut butter gives it a little extra kick that I love. I've also added a banana to the shake and been quite satisfied. Both variations of the shake make me feel like I'm not drinking a diet shake. If you're counting on using these shakes as meal replacement without snacks, I'd advise against it. After three hours I start to need a little something. At these times, I like to eat a few crackers, some dried fruit, a few slices of cheese, some peanuts, or a packet of fruit snacks. There are more nutricious choices, but my choices of snacks is what keeps me from eating too much. And that's what matters in the end.\n",
      "This is a diet I would recommend it is so easy to stick to and you will lose weight at a reasonable rate\n",
      "Tastes really good, but does not keep me full for very long at all.  I usually just make this to drink on my way to work, then have a small breakfast an hour or too later.\n",
      "I purchased this to help supplement my weight loss efforts as I'm really terrible at making/preparing breakfast for myself everyday. I used this faithfully for one week, and felt pretty good. However, during the second and third consecutive weeks of using this in the morning (and eating balanced meals for the remainder of the day) I started to notice it was not being tolerated by my stomach. I would get ridiculously gassy and would have stomach pains. I tried different types of liquids (water, soy milk, 1% milk, etc) and got the same results with each. Unfortunately, I had to stop using this. Once I stopped, the stomach pains immediately went away. I still use it once in a while, but the stomach pains return more often than not so I've decided it's best just to throw it out.The good thing is that if this is something that you've been able to use and tolerate in the past, the 31 ounce canister is a great value through Amazon. This product would have definitely lasted a long time if I had decided to continue using it.\n",
      "**I could not be more disappointed with this purchase.**I started losing weight in mid-September and was steadily losing two lbs a week. For reference, I cut my calories down to 1200 and started on the elliptical. I decided to buy this shake mix since it doesn't have high fructose corn syrup like the cans and I wanted a drink for breakfasts(solid foods early in the day make me feel sick for a few hours, I was hoping this would be a great way to get around that.) I started drinking it every morning starting November 1st, while adjusting my solid food intake to about 1000 calories, and I immediately plateaued. I even GAINED a pound and had to work really hard to burn it off.Most people gave this stuff 5 stars?? REALLY!?!?!?! It seriously makes me hate advertisers who use product reviews to sling their junk. I'm trying to lose literally half my body weight while battling severe back problems, I do not need this. I stopped the Slim Fast breakfasts at the last day of November and BAM! by December 2 I'm down 4 lbs. This is ridiculous. It should have helped me instead of making things more difficult. I don't know if it's the sugar content or what, but I will never be buying this shit again.\n",
      "This is great and fast breakfast and lunch. The larger size is very convenient. The flavor is outstanding and the drink nutritious. I have it on subscribe and save (which reduces the price). That means I have it set to to be sent automatically and I don't have to keep going to the store to get the smaller cans.\n",
      "I use this in the morning and at lunch as a substitute. I have found that blending it with some frozen fruit (like strawberries and blueberries) is quite delicious, and makes it more like a milkshake/smoothie. It holds me over for about 2-3 hours.\n",
      "Have been drinking this shake for many years. Although they are great and deserve 5 stars, I recently ran out and ended up purchasing bars. The bars offer so much more flexibility and convenience. Not to mention the amazing taste. I have stopped using the powder formulationa nd use only the bars.\n",
      "I've been using the slim fast shakes for about 7 months now and have hands down loved the Chocolate Royale flavor. While I enjoy the other flavors I've found that this is the only one I really look forward to drinking in the morning. I, like everyone else, was pretty upset when the slim fast company significantly raised their prices on their canned shakes by putting them in a plastic bottle. However, I've found the shakes the be really helpful, not just for my weight loss, but as a great quick breakfast.I have always been the type of person who cannot function without breakfast, but I am also the person who is running out the door the last minute I need to leave in the morning. These shakes have made my morning struggle much easier because breakfast is easy and a no brainer.I loved my shakes so I couldn't get rid of them and opted to try out the mix powder. I simply add the milk and powder to one of those power-ball shakers (usually used for protein shakes) mix it up and drink it in the car. I find the power-ball shakers make the shake very frothy and oh so yummy!A MUCH cheaper alternative to the bottled version and SOOO much better when shaken up.\n",
      "I've been drinking the pre-mixed Chocolate Royale shakes sporadically for about 10 years and I find the chocolate taste in the powder to be a lot tastier than the premixed shakes!  I was very pleasantly surprised.  I didn't give it the 5th star because it never seems to mix fully.  I took the advice of others and use it in a shaker, but it still never mixes perfectly for me.  I have NOT tried it in a blender though, so that might help.  Also, rather than drinking it at once as a meal, I sip it over an hour or so as a beverage, so it separates a lot and needs to be reshaken during some of that time.  I'm the kind of person who is hungry every two hours or so and that is still the case with the shakes, but the plan DOES include a snack between shakes, and an apple is sufficient to get me between my morning shake and lunch.\n",
      "SLIM FAST DOES NOT NOT NOT I REPEAT NOT MAKE YOU SLIM.... THIS IS FULL OF SUGAR AND FAT...SLIM FAST WILL MAKE YOU FAT...\n",
      "The chocolate is delicious and I use it when I've three hour classes or at work! I do not use as much as directed because it is sooooo chocolatey! I use between 1/2-2/3 the scoop and it still leaves me full!\n",
      "The shake mixed with some ice cubes, milk, and a 1/2 banana keeps me full all morning. It is great to have on the go!\n",
      "I started using Slim Fast 23 years ago when I needed to lose weight after having my baby. I used it for a month and lost 8 pounds. After that, I used it, not to lose weight, but because I loved the taste of it. I actually put my milk in the freezer for about 45 minutes so it is icy cold. Then I mix in about a half a scoop of chocolate slim fast powder. It is so delicious -- to me, it tastes just like a FUDGECICLE (from my childhood days).  ... And, the fact that there are so many nutrients included, is a plus!  I strongly recommmend this product.\n",
      "Hmmm. My Mother drinks these so I thought I would try it. However there is no way I could drink these every day.\n",
      "After they switched to bottles and hiked up the prices I bought a can of the powder SF. I love it so much. I have a magic bullet and so I add 3 or 4 ice cubes and crush/mix it all together and it is the best breakfast ever. It does tend to seperate quickly so I don't make it until I am ready to drink it. Sometimes I will put in a Coffee To GO cup and it works great.This obviously wouldn't work at lunch in an office, but you could always prepare it in the morning and put it in a spill proof cup/lid. Keep it in the fridge and shake it up really good before you drink it. Never hurts to just try it.I think it is about $6-7 for a 12.83 oz can at Walmart. This makes 14 shakes.Me and my husband drink it for breakfast. We go thru about 1 gallon of skim milk every 5 days, not really sure. I'll assume that I spend $4 on milk a week. So that is $10-11 a week for 14 shakes.It seems to be better priced at Walmart than I just saw on Amizon, but mabey my math is wrong.It took my husband about 4 weeks before he would try my version of the shakes, he was still using the bottles (that sounds weird). He loved it too. He admitted he was wrong and mine was better and learned how to make them himself the next day.\n",
      "Excellent service, and packaging is excellent. And excellent quality and sent on timeMy advice to deal with themMy advice to deal with them\n",
      "I have been using this product for years. Very satified, especially when I add a banana or other fruit in the blender with the mix.The only proablem is other than Sam's Club and Amazon I haven't been able to find the same size in the stores.  The smaller sizes available are more expensive.\n",
      "I start off every morning with a shake made from this, a little ground cinnamon, a tbs or so of Metamucil powder, and fat-free milk. The taste is great & I'll even make myself up a shake to take with me to class in the evening after work so I'm not ravenous by the time I get home. The only thing I don't like about it (or most \"weight-loss meal replacements\" in general) is there's quite a bit of sugar. Through hard work at the gym, willpower at work and home, I've lost 16#s in 3 mos but I am NOT following SlimFast!'s 3-2-1 plan (WAY too much sugar and I was ALWAYS starving bc of it.) Great product otherwise, but I DO miss their pre-made shakes in a CAN...\n",
      "If I was committed like I was in previous years, this would be the bet thing to happen to you. Good plan to reasonably loose weight fairly quickly. Good price too\n",
      "Folks this is cheaper at WalMart. I love it but I am frugal and like to save money.After taxes at store very close.\n",
      "I like the chocolate but not the sugar in it. Reducing the sugar content would help in losing weight. Let me wait and see how it helps me.\n",
      "Excellent buy on a product I love!  Just wish I'd not selected the shipping choice I did on Glucerna! LOL! But, I'm very happy with this Slim Fast!\n",
      "If you are sick of that whey-like chocolate phony taste that comes in so many diet shakes, this is a much better choice for you. It's the only one I can drink now that makes me think of REAL chocolate and not \"chocolate cardboard\" as I like to call it.I did get better results with some of the other brands but I suspect it's because I wanted fewer of those as sometimes I'd just get sick from thinking about the phony, chemical flavor they called \"chocolate.\"By the way, this mixes very easily in your shaker. You don't get those left-over little globs all around the bottom.\n",
      "I love this for breakfast even when I'm not dieting and I've found the optimum way to prepare it (for myself, anyway) and thought I'd pass it along: you put  skim milk in a shaker (use one with measuring marks on it to get the 8 oz. of milk lined up right), add the scoop of S-F, then a couple of ice cubes. Shake it like you're making a martini, for a couple of minutes, then pop it into your freezer for about 15 minutes and then use a straw, for that real milkshake feeling! Trust me, it's worth the wait. It comes out thicker and colder and more satisfying than a blender can ever make it. You can adjust the freeze time to your preference or to your particular freezer. Awesomely delicious.\n",
      "I had planned on using this for breakfast/lunch everyday to aide in weight loss. I did not do that, but every once in a while I'll use it for breakfast/lunch on a weekend and I'll switch between this and cereal for breakfast during the week.If you can stick to it every day for at least breakfast you'll start to notice a bit of a difference. It is pretty healthy for you as far as vitamins go, and I personally enjoy the taste, though the powder doesn't dissolve well in cold milk.I recommend this for anyone looking for a weight loss aide that tastes good. Try heating up the milk in the winter and it will be like hot chocolate for breakfast (and to help dissolve the powder), otherwise the undissolved powder still tastes fine.I got this for about 1/2 of what it normally goes for and it was very worth it, I was finally going to stick to it every day and the price went up, but its still reasonable.\n",
      "The one can is equal to 3 of the standard size.  I love paying a lower price and replace the individual cans at the same time.\n",
      "It's what I drink immediately after working out, following the \"Golden Hour\" rule (have a carb/protein snack within 1 hr. after heavy workout, helps with recovery, building muscle, metabolism...).  I could have a peanut butter sandwich, or even chocolate milk, but this is full of vitamins, goes down quickly and has fiber!\n",
      "I am a terrible dieter.  I love my sweets.  Especially chocolate.  This is really the only diet plan that works for me because the Chocolate Royale is delicious and chocolate and when mixed with skim or soy milk and ice it's like having a chocolate shake.  It controls my hunger so I don't snack between meals and satisfies my chocolate cravings.\n",
      "Well, I think it's delicious because it has a lot of sugar in it so if you're looking for a diet that cuts out sugars, this probably isn't a good idea. I also don't think it keeps me feeling full for more than 2 hrs (nowhere close to the 4 it claims), but it's still a yummy breakfast shake. Like previous reviews have said, the Chocolate Royale is hard to dissolve with a spoon but put it in the blender with low fat/non-fat/or even soy milk with some ice cubes and it's really good!\n",
      "I started this around 2 and a half months ago, followed the directions as closely as I could, and I lost 20 pounds so far! It tastes great and it eliminates my cravings for sweets. It says to exercise along with the plan, but I haven't done that, and I didn't need to. Great product!\n",
      "Some reviewers mentioned that they mix it with water??? I don't think you're supposed to do that, you're supposed to use non-fat milk.Anyway, unsure whether they changed their formula, the first can I got did not mix too well as others have mentioned, but the second one mixes easily with no issues.The powdered product tastes better than the cans for sure. The mix of vegetable fats and fiber does a good job supressing your appetite. It is not too hard to keep near 1200 calories per day without feeling like you're starving. I have lost about 5 lbs in about 2 weeks. (hopefully fat, not muscle) Be sure to have plenty of protein, eat smart, fruits and V-8 or something. And the 500 calorie meal they recommend...that's a substantial meal if you don't lard it up with butter and cheese.\n",
      "I am usually famished when I come in from work and with this in the house, I can resist the temptation to eat something bad. The Chocolate Royale flavor is very rich, not too sweet, and dissolves completely in milk without using a blender. You'll feel like your cheating and drinking a big glass of chocolate milk! I'm not giving it 5 stars because it (for me) it is not filling enough to serve as a meal replacement, it only postones my hunger.\n",
      "This is a staple in my pantry! No-brainer good-for-me breakfast! Versatile! Add soy, almond, or cow's milk. Change up the flavor with mashed banana, and/or coffee. Never get tired of my Slim-Fast shakes! I've lost 50 pounds thanks to the Slim-Fast plan. You can too!\n",
      "Personally, I've been having good results with Slim Fast as an aid in my diet.  I have a shake every morning for my breakfast.  What I really like about this product is that it's good for you and really helps with any chocolate cravings that you might be having.I don't have anything bad to say about the product, I think it's very good and it is what it is, a delious nutrition shake.\n",
      "This thing tastes like chocolate milk (if you add milk) but it is hard to dissolve in milk with a spoon. I highly recommend the strawberry because it has no problems dissolving. It must be the cocoa causing the problem.\n",
      "Just what I wanted, not always available in stores, good price and quick delivery.  The flavor of the powder with milk from your own refrigerator is much tastier than the canned liquid Slim-Fast in the stores.\n",
      "great little pick me up before and after exercising. Feel the difference after a few days.  easy mixing and good tasting. I use almond milk for a more enjoyable shake\n",
      "This protein powder really delivers!I’d rather have real sugar than any stevia or Erythritol so that was my first criteria for protein power. This one seemed like a good choice with minimal ingredients, low added sugar and less fillers than other products.It tastes great with water, milk, or almond milk. Obviously different bases make it creamier. I mix 1 scoop (10g protein) with cold water and mix with my handheld frother for a few seconds - works perfectly! If it’s too grainy let it sit for 2-3 mins and mix again.Chocolate flavor is light but you can taste the real cocoa powder flavor. Excited to try vanilla on the next purchase!\n",
      "I love the chocolate! Great flavor, tastes just like chocolate milk. I would prefer a less gritty texture, but I'll still drink it.\n",
      "tastes like butter pecan which is my favorite, it does fill you up and blends smoothly!\n",
      "Not big on this. It's been a while since I've had vegan protein powder but the flavor of Orgain isn't great - extremely sweet. I've been mixing it with plain kefir, spinach, and blueberries. Still super sweet. We'll see if Vega is any better.\n",
      "I had been using the regular Orgain powder for years and was shocked when I recently read the ingredients and saw Erythritol! I could’ve sworn the last time I checked that was not an ingredient! My diet is low carb but I’d rather have 5g of real sugar than engineered and a bunch of other fillers like sunflower oil and gums. It’s twice the price for a month’s supply but feel better using it.I struggle with weight and I find when I start my day with a smoothie it sets my entire day differently. I also add my own frozen spinach, berries, and an array of other powders such as turmeric, matcha, ashwagandha, maca, Ceylon cinnamon, prebiotics, star anise, ginger, cacao, and flax seeds.Truly helps digestion and depression too.\n",
      "After taste was terrible.\n",
      "I really tried to like the taste of this protein powder, but it did not taste good at all. Now I have a whole jar of protein powder I will never use and cannot return. I just wish there was more reviews about the flavor because this just wasn't for me.\n",
      "I've been vegan 30 years and it's always a challenge to get a good, clean protein powdwe without \" stuff\" in it. I tried the Orgain w/ superfoods, and while I like flavor, I had the same \" brain- fog\" reaction to any product with stevia in it.  I took a chance on searching \" vegan protein powdwe- no stevia\", and this one came up.  I just tried it- outstanding flavor. Mixes great w/ water, so it's not runny or weak-tasting.  Actually sweeter than I thought it would be.\n",
      "Decent product\n",
      "Love that it’s mostly organic. Too sweet, in my opinion should not have added sugars at all.Nothing good or organic about natural flavors.. This product would be perfect if these two ingredients would be removed. Considering that this product was founded by a doctor and cancer survivor you would think these two things would not be in this .\n",
      "I've been ordering this for over a year now. Orgain's Simple line of shakes are the only ones I can drink with zero digestive issues. So many others contain sweeteners that cause annoying side effects, but not this one. Peanut butter is my favorite! I add half a banana and it's wonderful. It'll keep you satisfied for a few hours too. I lost 127lbs and this has helped me lose (along with exercise) and now maintain my weight.\n",
      "This when mixed tastes far too sweet to only have coconut sugar in it. There must be some Stevia in there. My wife and I can’t stand Stevia and can taste it a mile away. Although there is not that famous Stevia nasty aftertaste, something about the overly sweet flavoring suggests Stevia. It is also too sweet for only 10 g of carbohydrate per serving. Orgain, fess up!\n",
      "Switched to this from “Vega” brand. Vega is a bit more heathy and has prebiotic but this organic brand tastes so good! I’ve tried many different mix in powders to replace chocolate milk in my and my toddlers diet and this is by far the closest tasting and the ingredients are real. Love it\n",
      "Love this protein powder but wish it was unsweetened I put it in my fruit smoothie every morning & don’t need sweetener.\n",
      "They fooled me with \"creamy vanilla\" and the ingredient list. It seemed perfect. The taste is awful. Look elsewhere for a plant protein powder.\n",
      "I received a Nutribullet for Christmas and have been trying some protein powders.  I got this in the vanilla flavor, thinking it would work well with anything else I put in it.  It blends fine, no weird mouth feel, but I don’t taste vanilla.  To me it tastes like peanut butter.  I do like peanut butter/peanuts but was hoping for more of an overall vanilla flavor.\n",
      "This protein powder was way too sweet for me. It had that terrible aftertaste of fake sweeteners and couldn't even be masked in a fruit smoothie. It was cheaper than what I usually buy so I gave it a try... Definitely a mistake.\n",
      "I just can't stand the taste of this protein powder.  I like its ingredients but I have a hard time getting it down.  I've used a lot of different plant based protein powders and this one is one of the worst tasting.\n",
      "Wtf this tastes so bad I’m confused by the other reviews. I know Vegan protein powder doesn’t always taste the greatest but I’m sensitive to whey and have been trying vegan protein for a few years now. This is the worst chocolate flavor I’ve ever come across, it tastes like spices and roots not chocolate…can’t return and wasted $30…going to stick to trying samples or something before I waste more money\n",
      "It is a little pricey but I am glad I found one with no artificial sweetener and that tastes good.\n",
      "I don't know what the ad says, but neither of those sugar subs are listed in the label.  It does have a bit more added sugar than other powders but prefer that to the aftertaste of stevia or erythritol. I use it in smoothies with added fruits or veggies, plant milk and sometimes nut butters, so the vanilla flavor works the best for me. I've tried lots of other powders and this is my favorite.\n",
      "It’s not bad it’s better if you use almond milk or something to blend it with other than just water\n",
      "Excellent chocolate flavor.Mixes into water easily. Not gritty.Excellent plant based protein source.I use it to get through my work days and muscle/ energy recovery.There's a very notable difference in my energy and strength levels throughout the day when do and don't have these protein drinks. It pretty much eliminates muscle pain and cramps from a hard workout. My job is much easier to do when I drink this stuff. I do a lot of lifting, pushing, pulling and walking at work and have long work days.Drinking one shake in the morning before work and one more midday works really well for me.\n",
      "Finally found a flavor that I liked at a good price and then the prices was jacked up..\n",
      "I like it. Stevia- free. Tastes like chocolate milk. Will cover the taste of greens, but won’t cover the taste of raspberries, etc. If you have binge eating disorder like me, you might binge it cause it tastes a little too good, but a little mild, so that you want more and more.\n",
      "I decided to try this, after my usual brand was unavailable and this is not bad at all.My need was for a protein powder to give my smoothie a boost and this does the trick.It blends well with my petsonal mix of berries and coconut milk.Try it for yourself!\n",
      "Did I get a bad batch? This may be the worst tasting protein powder I've ever tried, I can't believe anyone can actually choke this down. It's not that I'm new to vegan protein powders either, or products without masking flavors. In fact, my favorite is currently a five ingredient pea protein powder from a company that rhymes with \"mega\" that is only sweetened with coconut sugar. I was expecting this powder to taste better based on reviews, but it's disgusting! I can't even describe the taste, it's so odd, and though it's not listed as an ingredient, mine ABSOLUTELY had a stevia aftertaste! And my whole reason reason for purchasing was because I am very sensitive to stevia and other sugar substitutes. I wish I had believed the reviews that this tastes like dirt, I actually think this must taste worse than dirt. I hate to think that I received a contaminated product, or something that's gone bad. I purchased the chocolate flavor that's shipped and sold from Amazon. I hope I can return it because it's expensive and tastes all kinds of wrong.\n",
      "This is the best chocolate protein powder I have had! Such good chocolate flavor and not too sweet. Great with just water, and even better with some coconut milk and a frozen banana! Yum.\n",
      "I really like the flavor of this chocolate it’s delicious ! Seems like it doesn’t stir up very easy but if you leave it sit for a minute it gets better . I didn’t use a shaker bottle though so that would probably help !\n",
      "I absolutely love this protein powder.  It tastes amazing and I was happy to find a protein powder without Xantham gum.\n",
      "I add this to my smoothie and it tastes and blends well.\n",
      "I honestly do not taste a vanilla flavor. Tastes very powdery. I did it in a fruit smoothie, very sweet. I will see if it grows on me\n",
      "Weird sugary sweet after taste. Tastes artificial and nothing like peanut butter.\n",
      "Very good\n",
      "I use water to make a fast health drink at 12 ounces and don’t add sugar this was mostly water tasting in first drink but am drinking for health benefits and have 50 superfoods coming in the mail for health improvement but I drank it easily and was hard to drink was good enough  on very first shake\n",
      "Good flavor, basic ingredients, I am trying vanilla next time though to mix it up!\n",
      "It's a good value. The serving size is two scoops. But, it makes your shake taste too chalky. It is worth the buy tho for a very clean product.\n",
      "I dont need to add fruits or anything to drink it. I just add unsweetened almond milk and it taste great. Makes me fill good.\n",
      "Taste great easy to use\n",
      "This is one of the best if not the best tasting protein powders I have ever bought. I have a bunch of allergies and so I have to be picky with brands but this brand is both healthy and delicious!! Buy it now don’t wait!\n",
      "I usually use a scoop and a half in about 12oz of water after a workout. The flavor tastes very sweet and delicious without any added sugar. I just wish this came in more flavors like chocolate.\n",
      "This protein powder is low on grittiness.  It tastes good!\n",
      "This doesn't taste good at all. Its also gritty and doesn't mix up well. Very disappointed\n",
      "I love this powder keeps me full for some time. Mixes well.\n",
      "This is my new favorite protein powder. It easily mixes in a shaker bottle and tastes amazing. I drink it all the time and never get tired of it. My son who has some eating issues will drink it sometimes too which is a huge plus. I will buy again and again.\n",
      "I have been using Vega simple, I can’t do sweeteners.  It blends nice and tastes great.  I thought I’d give Orgain a try after someone suggested it.  It’s super thick and grainy even using my ninja and the chocolate is SUPER chocolaty.  Like too much.  I’ll stick to Vega.\n",
      "My family all really love this protein powered. Great option if you are gluten free\n",
      "Trying to figure out if I received a bad batch or if the powder is supposed to look grainy.\n",
      "This is a great back up plan when my choice is out\n",
      "Great source of plant protein but too expensive. We got this for our teen son who is bodybuilding and I don’t like all the protein powders with all those chemicals in them. He likes this OK but I don’t love the price as it’s more expensive than the others per ounce.\n",
      "We love this product.  Whole family enjoys the taste in our morning smoothies.  But it is hard to be happy about the packaging.  Can't it be put in some kind of air-tight bio-degradable packaging instead of this HEAVY DUTY plastic jug that just ends up probably going to the landfill. (even tho I give it to recycling).  I don't need this container!!!!\n",
      "This is a great vegan protein powder! It’s smooth mixed up with almond milk and the flavor is great ! A must have for quick morning breakfast or a after workout snack !!\n",
      "I liked the original Orgain, but I hate the aftertaste from stevia. I switched over to this hoping it would be better, and I wasn't disappointed. The sugar content isn't too bad, and the taste (at least for the chocolate one) is very good. I'm not a fan of the vanilla, and I haven't tried the peanut butter one yet.I'd say the only thing I don't like is that it doesn't mix well, much like the original Orgain. You pretty much have to use a blender if you want to mix it into anything. It's also difficult to clean off of surfaces. It tends to cake on things and harden, which is really annoying. It doesn't do that when I mix it really well with my Vitamix blender, just when it's not mixed thoroughly enough.\n",
      "I was disappointed at how chalky it was. I mixed it with the chocolate flavor and only put in a half of scoop but it was still very chalky.\n",
      "I have never tasted a protein powder drink. I will have to get my protein with another source. I couldn't even choke down the first sip! Maybe I will try to blend with peanut butter and bananas....... just so it doesn't go to waste.\n",
      "Love the product and the price\n",
      "I will be buying it again.  I made it will almond milk. It probably tastes good with milk too!\n",
      "Given the variety of reviews, I was concerned about the taste, as I wanted something that I could just mix with water only. This is really tasty. It has a slight nutty flavor, and chocolatey, which I personally like. May be off-putting to some people, but I love it. Main thing is no artificial sweeteners, including stevia or monk-fruit. Has a little bit of sugar, but I am ok with that.\n",
      "The flavor is mild and it blends wonderfully. Add a little banana, milk (I prefer organic soy) and some frozen berries and you've got a delicious, healthy shake. I like this more than any with the stevia in it... not a fan of that overly sweetened flavor. This was perfect! Thanks Orgain!\n",
      "Chocolate flavor is good\n",
      "I like the vanilla flavor. It comes with a nice scooper. Keep in mind there's some sugar in this.I also had Orgain's sugarfree chocolate flavor. It tasted way worse. I'm not sure if it's cuz it was chocolate of cuz it had artificial sugar.\n",
      "It’s very sweet and fake tasting. Did not care for it and couldn’t even finish it\n",
      "Recently I had to give up dairy products and wasn't sure what brand of protein powder to buy for my morning fruit smoothie, I have always used whey. I deiced to give this one a try and my search stops here, this protein powder is so good, I bought the vanilla flavor. I don't use a full scoop in my smoothies, I use 2 TBSP in mine as a little extra flavor. It is so good, the best I've tried since giving up the whey protein powders. I will definitely keep buying and am going to try the chocolate next time! ~ Robert's Wife~\n",
      "Blends well with a blender bottle, but ok with just a spoon.  Great flavor, even the non-mixed powder is tasty. No chalky to me.  No fake sugars or sugar alcohols to mess with you.  I use it as a shake or add to oatmeal, etc.\n",
      "This is one of the best tasting protein powders I've had!  The peanut butter flavor is amazing.  I have a shake mid-afternoon and it ties me over until dinner without me getting hungry.  Having the shake at this time also decreases the amount I eat at dinner because I still feel satiated from the shake.\n",
      "Good Product, blends well even with just ice and water which I sometimes have at night for a chocolate snack.I had no trouble digesting.I will buy again\n",
      "Amazing ! I LOVE IT!! great taste and no stevia !! Win win!\n",
      "This stuff is simply the best. It tastes great, it doesn't cause any intestinal distress in any of my family members, it blends well, and it doesn't contain any nasty ingredients that anyone in my family can't have. It makes a great hot cocoa and is a delicious addition to coffee or coffee alternatives. I even add a few scoops to my daughter's homemade granola bars to make them extra tasty and nutritious. And it isn't ridiculously overpriced, especially with subscribe and save.\n",
      "This is the best tasting and healthiest protein powder I have come across. I've already bought more to have on hand. I used to struggle trying to have one every morning but now I look forward to it. I blend a serving of this with 1&1/4th cup of almond milk, a spoonful of organic peanut butter and one frozen banana.  It's delicious, filling and boosts my energy better than my coffee does. It dissolves well (not perfectly, but well). The peanut butter flavor could be a little stronger. That's why I add just a little extra peanut butter to my smoothie. Otherwise, a nearly perfect protein powder. I wish I could get a hold of this in a larger amount. I've also purchased the peanut butter cup flavor.\n",
      "I tried this and Vega Simple and this has a lot more flavor, more vitamins, more protein.  It’s worth the extra money in my opinion.  It blends well and is like a dessert when blended with almond milk and peanut butter and some ice\n",
      "I’ve had to go dairy free but I hate the aftertaste of artificial sweetners (including stevia). After wasting money on many others I decided to give this one a go and it is sooo good. Love that it has what you need in there but it’s sweetened with coconut sugar. Even my husband that normally drinks the whey protein really likes it.\n",
      "This is the most disgusting protein powder I've ever had. The flavor is terrible! I had to cut down to one scoop in my smoothies (that also contain plain Greek yogurt, spinach, berries, flax seeds, and banana) and I still can't overpower the nasty flavor. I am choking it down because I'm not wasting my money, but UGH I'm literally dry heaving trying to drink this. Maybe chocolate is better?\n",
      "I was worried this powder was gonna taste really bad but it's great! I've been an Olly protein gal but they have discontinued their powders to focus on vitamins. Their Vanilla was my go to but I'm happy to say that I've found my replacement. This powder blends great and tastes only slightly nutty considering it's made of nuts. I blend it in soymilk with a frozen banana and splash of lactose free milk, tastes amazing! There are no lumps and has a smooth consistency. Took me a while to find a stevia free and vegan powder that tastes good but this is a winner. I'm not vegan but I do not like whey based protein so this is a definite win. Will be purchasing the chocolate one next and definitely reordering the vanilla. Happy smoothie-ing! 😊\n",
      "This is a BIG RIP OFF. I suspected it would not be up to 15 servings in the container when I opened and found it was just a little above the half mark inside the container. I made a conscious effort to ensure I only take an accurate measure of the scoops(levelled) each time. Low and behold I ran out at 12 scoops. I have since switched to Nature Bounty Protein Shake and it's a better value for money. I have a little more than the stated servings. ORGAIN =BIG RIP OFF\n",
      "Tastes great, healthy, Kosher\n",
      "So freaking good!!!! No stevia (I’m allergic) and deliciousI’ve tried them all!!!\n",
      "I chose this protein powder because of the simplicity of the ingredients.  Not a lot of fillers, no artificial sweeteners, etc.  I first used a shaker cup and plant milk, but the graininess was really noticeable.  Then I got out my Vitamix high powered blender, and used cold skim milk plus a handful of ice cubes with two scoops of the powder.  Even after blending thoroughly, there is still quite a bit of graininess.  So, four stars just because I don’t like the sandy texture.  Aside from that, the flavor is great and with the addition of ice, it’s more palatable.\n",
      "Primera vez que compro esta proteina. Dentro de las proteinas a base de plantas que he probado esta es una de las mejores para mi gusto a pesar de lo dulce que es al paladar. Para evitar esto ultimo uso un scoop con 8 oz del liquido deseado; de ser bebida vegetal preferiblemente que sea sin endulzar ni sabor añadido o simplemente agua. La mayoría del tiempo lo preparo con 1 banana congelada y media taza de avena. Intentare los otros sabores de esta proteína.\n",
      "The flavor is fantastic- no gross stevia or monk fruit taste. I’ve bought this brand in peanut butter about ten times now, it’s far superior to any other brand/flavor I have had and I’ve probably tried a hundred of them over the years. Highly recommend mixing the PB flavor with a banana, almond milk, and some hemp hearts for a nutrient dense post workout breakfast. :)\n",
      "For what it is, the flavor is likable, though if you are not wanting a moderately strong peanut flavor you may find it tricky to disguise. Of course its a natural to combine with bananas, chocolate, or fruit. But for achieving a neutral vanilla flavor, that aint gonna happen. Its a good product, just to be clear.\n",
      "I’ve been struggling to find a protein powder without whey that has a good flavor and I’ve had this one and the vanilla and they are both delicious! 10/10\n",
      "Great taste - vanilla flavor is delicious, and good source of protein! Great option for those who can't handle whey - the main source or protein is pea protein, and works so much better for gut health too. Mixing with water or plant milk is yummy either way.\n",
      "This was overly sweet and gritty.  It left my stomach cramping for days.\n",
      "I get an upset stomach from whey and this is a great alternative. The flavor is really good & I’m glad I found a peanut butter kind.\n",
      "Love the simple flavor. Not chalky.\n",
      "The product is great tasting; however the manufacturer has terrible customer service.  Should you have any questions about their products or need assistance with this product you're sent to a black hole - email and phonecalls remaining unanswered. Mine came without a scoop and I just had some simple question about that and they never responded or picked up the phone . Too many companies behave this way anymore, and they don't deserve our support.(Amazon - this review IS about the product and manufacturer which directly tied to the quality of this product. It is not about the seller.)\n",
      "It really exceeded my expectations. Can’t taste the protein. I blended with real fruits ( frozen bananas, mangos or berries ) and it was delicious. No need for extra sweetener at all!\n",
      "It actually wasn't bad tasting but my stomach just couldn't tolerate alot of belching and bloating.\n",
      "It was nice to finally find a dairy free protein powder that didn’t contain Stevia. The vanilla flavor is delicious and tastes like a treat. However, there is still grittiness present, even after having used a Vitamix blender. I would still buy it again and want to try the chocolate and peanut butter flavors next.\n",
      "Our family love the product  but all of sudden the amount is got cutdown half. That is only disappointing. Thanks\n",
      "Flavor was great and item was sealed but within 15 min of ingesting this protein power my toung bcame severely irritated as if burned!! and I developed a nasty headache and my motuh was inflamed. My Toung bothered me for several days after. Not sure what's going on with this formula...also note I'm not allergic to any of the ingredients in this product. I've consumed all of them in other protein powders before with no issues.  Be careful buying!!! Something is wrong with the formula possibly in the one I received.\n",
      "Was less amount than previously expected\n",
      "Tastes great with just water and easy on the stomach.\n",
      "Great tasting with almond milk but expensive.\n",
      "Flavor was really unpleasant. Bought it to make smoothies but gave the smoothie mix a really chalky texture. Tried it in a shaker cup per the product box instructions and it did not get better.\n",
      "This Organic Plant Protein Powder, Chocolate had such a bad taste I only tried it one time.\n",
      "I always find peanut butter flavor anything never tastes… well… peanut buttery enough for me… this hits the spot… it’s also a great supplement like to add a little more protein to my shakes I add half a serving to uo the protein and change the flavor also really good mixed in yogurt\n",
      "The flavor of this product was amazing. It was slightly sweeter than other protein powders but sugar is still important in a balanced diet. It definitely held me over when mixed with almond milk and collagen powder. Would definitely purchase again!\n",
      "I just use 1 scoop with all 2-scoop proteins bc 2 is too much and the shake is too thick for my liking. This protein is awesome! No worries about ANY of the ingredients or sat fat and cholesterol levels. It’s dissolves nicely in my unsweetened coconut milk, tastes great, and keeps me satisfied when I have it for breakfast. I couldn’t ask for more. Get it! You won’t regret it IMO. 👏👏\n",
      "I love the chocolate powder. It is not too gritty. I mix it with either oat or almond milk and tart cherry juice.  It tastes like a black forest cake. Very refreshing and has been helping with muscle recovery and soreness post workout.\n",
      "This was my first time trying Orgain products and I am happy with it. I did my due diligence about checking for the quality issues before buying (they had been resolved and the independent report was updated to reflect the new testing) and considered other reviewers' comments on the taste.I found the taste to be quite good but I wasn't expecting a protein powder to taste like something it wasn't or have its flavor artificially enhanced either. It's powdered legumes with some chocolate, basically, so it has a touch of peanutty taste to it too.All in all, we're satisfied and will purchase this and other varieties of Orgain mixes in the near future.\n",
      "I’m a sucker for a protein shake, it’s easy and you get your protein all in one. This shake here requires no maintenance, you don’t have to add anything to it with its flavor it’s amazing. I considered adding Peanut butter to it but it’s so good it doesn’t need anything extra. If your wondering if it’s good it definitely is !! When I’m low on my mix I Will buy again\n",
      "I don't know what it is, but this protein powder has a weird taste. It's a little too sweet for me and I'll probably not repurchase.\n",
      "I'm trying a high protein diet but I'm largely non-dairy and was eating a ton of processed carbs. I tried whey and some plant based protein powder but all of them made me sick - I thought they were gross and I felt horribly nauseous for days. This protein powder is the answer! I got vanilla and peanut butter and could not be happier. They blend well, taste great, and I'll actually eat them.\n",
      "I like Orgain protein powder, so I figured I would try this one out. I usually purchase the chocolate flavor in the regular white and green packaging (I think it's not as natural as this one?). This one doesn't come with as much protein powder and the taste is a little bit more gritty and chalky than the original. I will likely go back to the original after I finish this one!\n",
      "This wasn’t very good to me n wasn’t worth the money\n",
      "Great tasting for plant based protein but the container is Tiny. I’m 6’4, 230 and go through one of these in a week and a half. It’s great but not exactly affordable for someone my size who is active and consumes at least 30 grams per serving (3 scoops instead of 2).\n",
      "Unfortunately, if you’re a texture person this product is not for you. It mixed well in a blender but I cannot look past the gritty/mealy texture in my smoothies! I wanted to love it due to the small amount of ingredients and vegan formula, but this just isn’t the best.\n",
      "Best protein shake I have ever had. I could have this everyday for the rest of my life.\n",
      "I don’t even know where to begin. I love this protein powder so much. I have several allergies and it has always been a struggle to find protein powder I can have. The ingredients list is so short, simple and perfect. I even add this to my baked goods now because it tastes so good and bakes well. I am buying three more right now before everyone else realizes how amazing it is.\n",
      "Flavor is good but grassy aftertaste, gritty.\n",
      "I have used other Orgain Products in the past, and have been very satisfied. I tried this product because it had no artificial sweeteners. I was disappointed in the flavor, not for lack of sugar. Will not purchase again\n",
      "The orgain simple with nuts ,seeds,golden pea ,no stevia.Creamy chocolate flavor is very tasty and filling.I like this better than Vega ,better taste,more protein, more quantity for cost. No artificial sweeteners (stevia) yuck and  dairy free. I will purchase again.\n",
      "I use it a couple of times a week. It dissolves in milk/yogurt/water really well. Tastes good. It does not have that horrible chemical-like taste, and that is why I like this product.\n",
      "Great product. Great value. Taste is pretty good\n",
      "I really like the flavor of this!! I don't agree with the people in the reviews who say it is too sweet.  I got the peanut butter flavor because people said the other flavors end up tasting nutty anyways.  I love it to help me add some nutrition in my diet.  However, if you have a sensitive stomach this might not be for you because I think it's the pea protein (idk though) that sort of makes my tummy feel weird if I drink it on an empty stomach in the morning.  With that being said , I do have a sensitive tummy myself and I'm still mostly fine to drink it.\n",
      "This protein powder taste sooooo good i can’t wait to have it every day i add milk to the powder and it’s such a treat for me . And knowing it’s so good for me is wonderful .\n",
      "I was diagnosed with a malnutrition disease SIBO, and was not absorbing nutrients. During the workup and attempts to cure this, and because my weight was falling precipitously, my GI doctor suggested this brand. I found that the Simple line was the best tolerated in my condition because it lacks Stevia. I cannot process many legumes (so no soy), many meats, much dairy (no whey), no FODMAPS (so not the \"greens\" version with broccoli)  You can see where this is going--extremely limited diet for a while.  I was able to make a shake with this, almond milk, a Costco frozen packet of Smoothe berries and kale/spinach they sell, and added some ground flaxseed.  I was able to digest this and could FEEL the nutrients hitting my body because I got energy, was able to walk up the stairs without collapsing, etc.  Fast forward to today where my issues are in remission. I am still making this daily because it tastes AWESOME.  I also have to stay on a modified diet to not exacerbate the SIBO. It is a pleasure to enjoy Orgain Simple Vanilla every day. I sometimes make it with pumpkin, frozen spinach/kale and pumpkin pie spice for a delicious pumpkin pie flavor.\n",
      "Just personal preference, I find the flavor to be unbearable. I bought the chocolate one and it tastes like burnt chocolate with a strong nutty undertone. I was really hopeful and excited to see so few ingredients.\n",
      "Love this stuff! Simple ingredients!!! Y use anything else\n",
      "I'm an insomniac and sometimes I get hungry at 2 in the morning. This is a great, healthy snack and it keeps me full until breakfast. It also tastes great!\n",
      "This product has a very peculiar taste and smell.  I have tried many of this company's products before with no problems but this product tastes gross.  I was excited to try this because it has organic ingredients but it was a huge disappointment.  I would not recommend buying it.\n",
      "Price was great got it on sale at $10, but the taste and texture is awful. Extremely gritty. Will be throwing this away, sadly wasn’t even worth $10.\n",
      "The pros: low calorie, low carb, low fat, plant-based protein shake.The cons: it's super gritty even when shaken for a long time and the chocolate flavor is pretty nasty tasting.Will I finish the container? Yes, because I refuse to waste fairly expensive protein powder. Would I buy it again? Not likely.\n",
      "mainly for breakfast.  Fast and nutritious\n",
      "I love the simple ingredients of this shake.  It shouldn't be so hard to find a shake without stevia or a list of other things I can't pronounce, but it is.  I love the nutty flavor mixed with half chocolate and half vanilla almond milk.  It mixes to a smooth consistency with my blender bottle and a couple of cubes of ice.  Since it doesn't have many vitamins, I also add a scoop of Amazing Grass greens blend superfood (in the chocolate flavor).  It makes it so so yummy!  It's my new favorite morning breakfast shake.\n",
      "So happy to find a yummy plant protein without any artificial sugars or fillers. I have gotten a few flavors in this line and all great.\n",
      "My only con is that this stuff clumps up even using a shaker bottle. But the overall taste is kinda nutty and isn't too bad at all, and there's thankfully no weird aftertaste from stevia. Being lactose intolerant, I've found a lot of plant-based products use stevia as a \"natural\" sweetener, but it has a very chemically aftertaste to me. Hope they don't change the formula to add stevia, and I'll keep buying this to add to my morning shakes.\n",
      "A good value for the quality, and taste of this protein powder.\n",
      "I'm not sure why manufacturers dump so much sugar or sugar substitutes in products, may be to fill up volume? I added just one scoop to oatmeal but holy cow, the cereal came out tasting like a milk chocolate with 100 grams of sugar, literally just exploded in my mouth and the after taste of sugar just doesn't go away. I believe sugar alcohols and substitutes do more damage than good. I would run the other way and look for something clean.\n",
      "I agree with others, this is just too sweet. Even using just one scoop the sweet is overpowering. Regardless of whether it is stevia, coconut sugar, refined sugar the sweetness alone floods your body with insulin. So as healthy as the other ingredients are this makes it very unhealthy. The flavor is awesome though.\n",
      "I suffer from cancer so to keep my protein up I make a drink which uses the ORGAIN SIPLE PLANT PROTEIN , So every day I start with my power drink , and it gives me more energy for the day.\n",
      "I love orgain protein powder! My favorite is the Orgain Simple vanilla flavor—such great flavor! I tried this (chocolate) as an alternative to the regular Orgain chocolate because I hate the erythritol sweetener in that one. Although this one lacks the artificial sweetener gross flavor, the chocolate flavor itself is lacking—nothing off putting, just not something I look forward to drinking. I may try combining it with the vanilla to see if that helps.Bottom line: good protein powder, flavor could be improved.\n",
      "This protein powder is so grossly sweet it's undrinkable. It's thoroughly disgusting and tastes toxic. Unless you're looking for an extremely artificially sweet tasting protein shake, I can guarantee you'll hate this.\n",
      "Overall it’s okay. Very gritty and an acquired taste. I used vanilla almond milk and it’s very sweet so I may just try water or make a smoothie with it. I like how it has simple ingredients and that’s why I decided to buy it.\n",
      "I was so excited to get this product, but when I opened my package there was powder all inside. It looks like I was sent an opened package and it’s contents spilled everywhere! Gross. I’ll be contacting the company to see if there is a way to remedy this. I love their products and have never had an issue, but an open container is just disgusting.\n",
      "I may have gotten a bad batch, but there are huge chunks of nuts that are as hard as plastic and kind of dangerous. I was drinking a smoothie I made with it (I didn’t inspect the powered before making the smoothie, but will do so going forward) and when I went to drink it kept getting huge pieces that felt like they’d break my teeth if I tried to bite them. Unhappy and won’t buy again. I’m fine having some unblended fruit chunks in a smoothie, but not going for crunchy. Makes me nervous and will throw away this can. What a waste :(\n",
      "Very good tast and love the clean ingredients and that it's vegan\n",
      "Finally, a protein powder that doesn’t upset my stomach and tastes good. I use vanilla, usually with frozen fruit. I don’t get a weird grit texture using my Ninja blender.\n",
      "Too sweet and tastes like oatmeal. You can also taste the Stevia.\n",
      "I put this in all my smoothies, it’s great it will take any flavor of the fruits and give the boost of protein in there.\n",
      "Tastes too much like a protein powder!\n",
      "I buy this version of their protein powder over the others because it doesn't have artifical sweetners (Stevia) like in all the other protein powders. I love the flavor. I mix this with oatmilk or almond milk, almond butter or regular peanut butter, a banana, and oatmeal. This is my go to breakfast (I work and have a baby) and am always on the go. I have a sensitive stomach and this sits very well with my tummy!\n",
      "I mix this powder with some frozen bananas, oat milk and yogurt and the smoothie is way too gritty.  Almost undrinkable.\n",
      "i get this at costco. its very good alone or with fruit added.  my favorite is mixed frozen berries and some flax added with cold water.  limited ingriedents is good\n",
      "I have added this to my fruit smoothies which are usually a berry mix + banana + yogurt + milk. Just one scoop of this is enough to turn a delicious smoothie into something I find myself “tolerating.” Maybe it tastes better with other ingredients, but it’s not for me.\n",
      "Cook Oatmeal in almond milk, add protein Powder during last  minute of cooki g. Add sliced strawberries on top. Absolutely delicious!!!\n",
      "I dislike the vanilla flavor it taste very artificial and  smells like purfume,  very off putting and is almost impossible to hide or blend. When i try to finish smoothie my body immidiately produces phlem/mucus at the back of my thoart making it impossible to drink i purchased two and now feel regret because I cant return it.\n",
      "Tastes very bad = I can't force myself to drink it.The two Orgrain 'powder' options I bought 'Organic Protein' and 'Simple' tastes so bad I cannot drink them. Taste does vary by individual, though, so keep that in mind.I did, however, love the premixed 'Orgain Grass Fed Clean Protein Shake, Creamy Chocolate Fudge - Meal Replacement, Ready to Drink'\n",
      "good flavor and great price cannot pass on\n",
      "I am enjoying this very much!\n",
      "This is not good by itself. It is bitter and has a strange taste. The only way we can drink it is by putting it in with a strawberry banana smoothie. I was a bit disappointed.\n",
      "I found this to be a great protein alternative. Much better than many of the other brands out there. No weird stevia aftertaste. And it blended pretty well.The main thing about this that folks are complaining about is the nutty taste. I feel that the manufacturer should have labeled it as a nutty vanilla flavor..because flavor wise, the nutty taste and the vanilla taste are both competing. But definitely not in a bad way.Aside from that, i feel that folks should have expected a nutty flavor considering that on the label it clearly states that the protein is all sourced from nuts and seeds.\n",
      "I always buy shakes and then take months to drink them cause I'm not a fan but this shake is so good I crave one everyday! I have been telling all my friends about it and ordering more everytime I see a sale!\n",
      "I always look for a protein that has the least amount of ingredients & that is also cost effective. This isnt the cleanest option there but it's not terrible. I wish it didn't have natural flavors in it but other than that the other *organic* ingredients are ok. It is flavorful and adds the perfect peanut butter taste to my smoothies & oatmeal, with out a chalky taste/texture. My BF tasted it and ordered one for himself immediately.\n",
      "Great taste, I like that the protein source come from a plant base. Delicious!\n",
      "Good protein powder with no fake sweeteners! The chocolate is very good with a nice chocolate flavor. The vanilla has a bit of an aftertaste. The nuts and seeds give it a slightly earthy taste but still taste good. Not gritty at all. The powder settles a little bit but I just swirl/shake before drinking and it's perfect.\n",
      "I was skeptical because of flavor's but this one tastes great, I can add fresh fruit, my collagen, very filling for a morning meal replacement.\n",
      "After reading all the great reviews on this product - I bought the chocolate and vanilla - I was truly disappointed.  I received the chocolate flavor first, made a smoothie, took one sip and had to dump the rest in the sink.  The flavor was horrible.  I could not stomach to drink the rest.  The vanilla I ordered just shipped, unfortunately now I am stuck with two containers of a vegan protein powder I will not drink.\n",
      "I was glad to find this vegan protein powder.  I like that it contains sugar and not nasty stevia.\n",
      "I don’t really like the taste\n",
      "This powder tastes a lot better than any other powder I've tried - nutty and not grainy. It mixed into a glass of milk very easily, and the consistency wasn't as gnarly as most.I'll be using this to fix my protein amount any day it's low - a very quick and easy fix.\n",
      "This is delicious. Sometimes I mix it with Dr. Berg’s chocolate and Kale shake and it is heavenly. But the peanut butter itself is also indulgent tasting on its own.\n",
      "Me encantó el sabor de esta proteína. Muy buena y de calidad 👌\n",
      "Great flavor and simple ingredients just like it says\n",
      "I have been using the original Orgain off-and-on for four years now. I’ve tried the Creamy chocolate fudge, the Chocolate Coconut and the Peanut Butter flavors. This is the first time I’ve tried the “simple” kind. It is grittier and I agree with the reviewer who said it tastes too sweet. Full disclosure though: I have never tried the original vanilla Orgain but I tried this in vanilla so I’m not exactly comparing apples to apples. Still, it’s not the flavor of it I dislike. It’s more the sweetness and texture. It’s fine and I’ll finish the bottle. If less ingredients are important to you (by the way, original Orgain didn’t do too badly on that score) this may be worth the sacrifice in taste. I prefer the original for taste and texture.\n",
      "I love this. Super creamy and very tasty. Be sure to mix very well. I mix with water and ice. I haven’t tried with plant based milk, but I’m sure it would be even creamier. I could drink this all day.\n",
      "This is exactly the reason why people have a hard time staying healthy. This is the 5th tub of protein powder I have tried (I don't even want to do the math) but this brand was no better than the previous four. can't even choke it down. going back to my \"justva little nasty\" Walmart, Equate powder.\n",
      "After almost 10 years of consuming mass quantities of whey protein, I made the switch to plant based. WOW! , my body really loves this protein, and I don’t get bloated or have any stomach issues. I mix a scoop of chocolate and a scoop of peanut butter into some low cal almond milk with some spinach and a banana and presto!!Have already re-ordered twice! It’s definitely worth a try !\n",
      "Doesn't taste as good as pure chocolate Orgain.\n",
      "Simple ingredients\n",
      "Bulk ordered my protein so of course go to use my second one after 30 day window and it was opened already. You can see on package the dried protein on the area that was opened already. Waste of money\n",
      "Great vanilla flavor. Slightly nutty, but I’m into that. Even with one scoop in my smoothie, I felt happily full for hours.\n",
      "Love this product! I wish it came in a pouch instead of a plastic canister. Pouches take up less room in the pantry and easier to take camping. Best of all I can pronounce all the ingredients!\n",
      "I bought the chocolate powder.I've been looking for quite some time for a reasonably priced protein powder. I preferred something vegan as well. No sugar alcohols like sucralose-- messes with my stomach. No or minimal stevia-- I'm okay with real sugar as long as it's not too much.And finally-- I have found the pot of gold.Kosher, vegan, tastes great, filling. I like to add fruit-- bananas, strawberries, blueberries- and chia seeds or pumpkin seeds. I also use almond milk to make my smoothies.I really couldn't be happier. I'm going to add this as a subscription item as soon as I submit my review.\n",
      "I really like this powder. Goes well with any milk, banana, almond butter or peanut powder, granola or oats and ice. No complaints. Get it and try it.  I don't know how it mixes alone with water. I bought this to add to my smoothies only and it mixes well.\n",
      "Having used an expensive mlm brand for many years, I needed to find a \"cleaner protein powder for dietary reason. This didn't disappoint. It mixes well, tastes fine on it's own and is undetectable in a smoothie. Best of all it doesn't cause any issues.\n",
      "These bothered my stomach (I tried two flavors) and Amazon won't allow return after a few days. Very disappointing.I also sent the company a message asking if they source ingredients from China but they never responded.Be careful - if you don't like this you're stuck with it!\n",
      "Great vegan protein powder that actually tastes great! It blends easy with a simple shaker cup. The consistency is smooth and not chalky like other protein powders: I’m impressed!\n",
      "The flavor is no where like the other plant based ones I have tried from Ordain. I was hoping to cut a few of the carbs by trying this but I jist can't drink it. It is almost like chalk to me. I use almond milk, almond butter, and frozen strawberries in all my protein drinks in the morning. I put it in my ninja blender with some ice and it still tastes like chalk and fake compared to the others I have tried.\n",
      "Super tasty, texture is decent. Very slight sandy-ness but blended in a smoothie its not noticeable. Recommend blending with a banana and milk!\n",
      "Orgain - please never stop making this!!! I absolutely love this protein powder. It doesn’t have a weird after taste, blends really smoothly, & isn’t artificially sweetened. Plus the ingredients are amazing and don’t leave my stomach feeling weird after. My go to is blending 1 frozen banana, 2 handfuls spinach, 2 scoops of this protein, and some almond milk. Delicious every time! The only con I have is the price for how small of a container it is, but I’ll still keep buying it.\n",
      "I picked this one because the ingredients are easy to digest and don’t aggravate my IBS. It is a little gritty compared to others, but I really like the nutty chocolate flavor. I only use one scoop to 1 cup almond milk and one cup of frozen fruit, mostly to hide the taste of the spirulina that I add. I’m about 5 smoothies in and think I will probably purchase again.\n",
      "My son loves this tastes and it’s a bonus to have the greens added\n",
      "I do not know what protien drinks people in these reviews are buying but this stuff is yucky. I had the chocolate and used it with almond milk and then as a smoothie with banana and spinach. It was gross both times. Maybe I'm not used to drinking these types of things but I couldn't drink it. I got a refund\n",
      "I mix this with toasted coconut almond milk and comsistency is a little textured, not bad. The taste of vanilla is a lot better than peanut butter cup from costco. Really like it.\n",
      "The flavor is amazing!! I hate when the overbearing aftertaste of artificial sweeteners ruins protein shakes. My only complaint is that the texture is really gritty when you only mix it with water. The seeds & nuts aren’t ground to a fine powder. There are still some small pieces which leads to the gritty feel & it settling to the bottom quickly. If it’s mixed in a smoothie or food, it would probably be much better.\n",
      "This taste more like peanut butter and vanilla. I feel if you don't like the peanut butter go with the chocolate instead of the vanilla.\n",
      "I purchased the chocolate and vanilla for smoothies. We enjoy the chocolate and have e tolerated the vanilla. The vanilla is mostly for kids berry smoothies, but I've tasted it and if you use more than one scoop, its awful. My grandkids seem ok with it, but it's gritty tasting to me.\n",
      "Nutty! Creamy! Smooth! Extremely Tasty! & VERY Delicious! I would recommend this protein powder! I most definitely will repurchase!!!\n",
      "If you are gluten-free and don’t want grains this is your yummy solution.. like flavorful nuts make yummy protein .. I say good for Keto too!!\n",
      "Had one glass and it was chalky in texture. I also got very sick 10 minutes after drinking it, causing me to be ill most of my evening. This product was terrible!\n",
      "Very happy with this product. It is made with natural ingredients and it is not repackaged and sold with cheaper ingredients. I have IBS so there are very few protein powders I can safely drink. All the fake sugar make me so ill. This is great for me and glad I can get it from this vendor and not have to drive an hour for it.\n",
      "I bought this for myself, and my husband has used it all. It must be REALLY good. Hopefully I'll get to taste it next time I order.\n",
      "A great tasting protein supplement that mixes well and has no aftertaste.\n",
      "While I love the ingredients in this protein powder, the taste was not very good.  I couldn’t even finish one cup of it.  I’m used to protein shakes and I’m not too picky, but this was not good.  And I can’t return it.  Definitely make sure you like it before you buy it!\n",
      "I was skeptical because I don’t do well with protein powders but I really enjoyed this one. I added one scoop with almond milk, half a banana, pb, flax, cinnamon and blended it with ice. It was delicious and a great meal replacement.\n",
      "Was looking for a protein powder that tasted good and would curb the hunger between work and working out in the evenings. This one does the trick! Tastes great, chocolatey and nutty without a weird aftertaste. Blends well in a blender bottle. Even tastes great with water! Even creamier with oat milk. I recommend it !\n",
      "Tastes really good not too grainy! I like it a lot!\n",
      "I read multiple reviews trying to find a good protein powder without “bad” addition ingredients ( fake sweeteners, etc). I wish I had paid attention to the reviews talking about the horrible flavor with this one. It’s a mouthful of salt, nuts, and horrible sweetness. I couldn’t get past the first gulp. I gave the container to my sister thinking, “maybe it’s just me?”  Only to receive a text from her asking, “ What is up with this stuff?”  I wanted to like it, but just couldn’t.\n",
      "My new favorite protein shake. Best one I've ever tried! No stevia is the best part.\n",
      "I’ve used many protein powders, includinga number that were more than twice the price and find Simple by Orgain to be the best.It dissolves relatively quickly, even in cold liquids, is considerably less gritty than most, has no artificial sweetener aftertaste and a rich chocolate flavor.\n",
      "The flavor of this is somehow off, to me. The same brand without the word Simple in it is much better.\n",
      "Delicious!!!\n",
      "This protein powder tastes great and mixes easily. Vanilla is misleading because it absolutely tastes like peanut. With that being said, I still really like it. It’s the only protein powder I’ve found without a weird aftertaste and has no artificial sugars yet is still healthy. If you’re looking for a protein powder for smoothies, oats, etc this is great. Real ingredients instead of artificial junk or oddly tasting monk fruit.\n",
      "Pretty good it was just very sweet for my liking\n",
      "Best flavor. Had a difficult time finding this size. Price is good. Other stores charged more for the smaller version.\n",
      "Has a gritty feel has an off taste little nutty but something else\n",
      "This actually taste really good and has low sugar compared to most. Perfect for protein smoothies.Does not have the typical chalk taste.\n",
      "The flavor is on point! I would suggest using 1 scoop instead of recommended 2 in almond milk to make less thick, however. Overall my 1st taste and use went well.\n",
      "The flavor is actually very good. I don’t know what other people are talking about, I found it really pleasing. It’s exactly how a protein shake should be. The fact that it’s plant based organic makes it even better. Definitely recommended.\n",
      "The ingredients are great. It blends nicely with any coconut water, almond milk, or whatever you use. I just won’t be buying vanilla again because it was too sweet for me. I had to cut it with plain pea protein powder by half. This time I got the chocolate peanut butter flavor sold at Costco and it wasn’t nearly as sweet tasting. And it was also double the size of this one and at the same price. Win win for me.\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE this protein powder! Simple easy to read ingredient list and the flavor is GREAT!! Will only buy this brand from now on!\n",
      "i really like this protein powder! about 2 weeks ago  i transitioned from vegetarian to fully plant based so i needed more protein. i hated vega so i saw this one and it taste really good! i’ve used it with oat, almond, and coconut milk and it tastes great with all even water. i mix it in with espresso and milk to make a “protein” iced latte sometimes as well\n",
      "Very good product the flavor I do love it why? Because remain me an old protein from my mom used to gave me so delicious thank you again I will buy it again\n",
      "It's too sweet for me. I can't understand how it's only 6g of sugar. Maybe because they used coconut sugar? Vega has a simple protein powder with the same amount of sugar per serving but its way less sweet. I'm hoping to make some anabolic ice cream with this. Will update my review after I've made it but so far it's just to sweet for me as a protein shake.\n",
      "This is my second time buying the Orgain Simple now and month 2 of using it. I'm actually really surprised! Almost every protein supplement/other supplements get to me and make me extremely sick. After using this consistently, I have had NO issues with my stomach reacting poorly to the powder. It's extremely natural and pure to what they they is in it. But it tastes soooooo good!!! I love the chocolate fudge kind and can't get over how fudge flavor it is! Great for drinks and protein ball recipes.\n",
      "Tasted great blended with oatmilk!\n",
      "Tastes terrible. Thick pasty goo. Maybe it’s great for you but between the consistency and taste, I can’t even choke it down.\n",
      "This tastes exactly like peanut butter and pretty gritty.\n",
      "Delicious\n",
      "It's definitely grainy, but I LOVE that there's no artificial sweeteners!  The chocolate flavor is just enough without being too much.  I will definitely buy this again!\n",
      "Horrible! This tastes and smells like peanut butter! Why is it labeled as Vanilla?\n",
      "Flavor tastes artificial.\n",
      "Love the flavor and easy to mix. I use milk and ice and add fruit,\n",
      "Like the taste, not too sweet and not chalky\n",
      "Half the size of your typical Costco Orgain protien bottle that selling for the same price. I should've checked the net wt.\n",
      "We bought the small version of 3 different well liked choc protein powders...husband: 6’4”, 230# ex athlete, adds 12 oz OJ, antioxidant juice, frozen fruits and a splash of milk; wife 5’3”, 125# non-athlete, adds antioxidant juice and 12 oz 1%milk.  Compared with  OWYN dark choc protein powder and Growing Natural choc protein powder.  All are veggie based (rice or pea).Here is our combined review: Orgain (this product) - thick due to 2 big scoops powder and borderline you-have-to-have-no-tastebuds-to-drink-this taste (yucky).  We actually threw it away.OWYN:  thinner (2 small scoops), does not froth but has the best taste overall.. like slightly grainy choc milk.  Most chocolate-y.Growing Naturals:  tastes slightly less chocolate, froths better, but caused things to move through our guts quickly, yes, for both of us.  Great to drink if prone to constipation perhaps. (We don’t normally discuss this kind of thing, but we both wondered if we had something wrong with us during the period that we used this powder in our breakfast shakes daily.)So we plan to stick with OWYN for daily use.I read this review to my husband before submitting and he is in agreement.\n",
      "I mixed with cashew milk (I prefer it over almond milk) and I couldn't get past the first sip.  It even smelled bad.  I tried adding frozen strawberries.  It didn't help.  I was so excited to try this product as I don't like artificial sweeteners , including stevia.  Unfortunately, it just didn't cut it.\n",
      "Delicious 😋 I'm definitely going to get this again! Vegan! No artificial sweeteners, just coconut sugar, low on the GI scale and that's definitely what I was looking for!\n",
      "Warning! Not all proteins powders are created with love & tested rigorously. I would not touch this brand.\n",
      "Love this product, this one WITHOUT Stevia. We were using Purely Inspired organic plant protein but we both dislike the after taste. Orgain Simple chocolate has a wonderful taste, that my daughter says \"taste like Hot Chocolate\". I've also made donuts with this, smoothies and shakes. Works great. Can't wait to try the other flavors. And really hope this company sees the need for people wanting just sugar vs the chemical taste of so much Stevie. Also, I would Not say this is overly sweet. I find it much more mild in comparison to the Purely Inspired brand. Again love this product. Please make more flavors.\n",
      "I use this to make morning smoothies.  I like that there are few ingredients, and yet the flavor is so good.  I'm disappointed about the added sugar in this product.  Otherwise, the quality is good and the flavor is excellent.\n",
      "The flavor isn't too bad as far as vegan protein powders go.  But the texture is so horrifically gritty that I can barely swallow it.  I mixed only half a serving with 6 oz almond milk and put it in my coffee.  I need to drink water as well, to rinse it down.  I feel like I'm drinking coffee with sand in it.  I'm glad I got it on sale but I still wasted $20 because I doubt I'm even going to get halfway through the container.\n",
      "I'm puzzled, given all the high reviews, and wonder if I may have somehow gotten a bad batch, but what I got I can barely swallow.  I tried it 3 times-- with coconut milk, almond milk, and cashew milk (all unsweetened).  Each time I took one drink and dumped the remainder.  It is really sickly sweet.  I can't make sense of it since it is lower sugar/carbs and doesn't seem to have other sweeteners.  I can't do whey,  need low(ish) carb options but can't tolerate the taste of stevia, so my options are limited.  I had high hopes for this one--- but it is a no for me.  My \"winners\" have been Nutiva Organic Plant Protein Superfood Smoothie,  Vega Protein Made Simple, and Spiru-tein Simply Natural.\n",
      "Vanilla flavor, nothing special about the taste.  Doesn't dissolve well in oat milk, not happy with the texture and thickness/clumpiness.  Seems to be a problem with pea protein powder.  This one does, however, keep me satisfied; I don't get hungry for a long time afterward.\n",
      "I'm a fan of this powder!  I'm particularly partial to the Chocolate flavor, but my daughter requested Vanilla, so I bought this for her.  Unfortunately, I didn't pay close attention to the size of the package, and didn't realize that it was significantly smaller than the equivalent product at Costco for about the same price.  Not a bait-&-switch, as the size is correctly indicated in the description, but disappointing in its own way . . .\n",
      "No grainy feeling, tastes great! The flavor is awesome and not too overpowering. I like that the flavor is different than the standard chocolate or vanilla.\n",
      "This is by far THE BEST tasting protein( I have only tried the vanilla so far) I have ever had and I have tried many from low cost to high cost from brand to brand! It mixes flawlessly, it tastes “clean” and delicious and I actually look forward to drinking my shake everyday. I add nothing but almond milk and just LOVE this product! Thank you, Orgain!\n",
      "my stomach always hurts from this so i stopped taking it immediate cramps and gas withbloating\n",
      "I tried it and I still felt hungry an hour later. I left it in my sons room and the whole room smells like the product. Then I took a little bag with me  to work and now my office smells like the protein powder. I don't think it should smell as over powering as a cologne.\n",
      "This thing smells terrible, taste like vomit, not worth buying. Sooo gross.\n",
      "This is great shake mix, very tasty and satisfying.\n",
      "This meal replacement shake is so bland.  Hardly has any flavor.  It was a mistake to buy it.\n",
      "This shake tastes horrible. Quest is somewhat better. If you would like bland fruity Milk of Magnesia - this will fill the bill!!  No returns so  it’s throwing money away.\n",
      "I love this product, I purchased it once on Amazon but now when I try to reorder, it says I have to pick it up at a store, so, what’s the point of ordering on Amazon? I may as well go to GNC and buy it.\n",
      "I drink this several times a day, each drink has 50%of daily protein requirements  and only 180 calories.\n",
      "Just got the chocolate pb flavor- tastes great but the scooper thing wasnt included after much literal digging. Hopefully ill see some GAINS asap lol\n",
      "Good for breakfast\n",
      "Pretty upset there’s only 6 packets in here, extremely deceptive description. Can’t return it, guess I’m stuck with these very overpriced packets.\n",
      "Decent taste and product, but the way it is worded, it looks like you are getting 25 servings, not 6. Sneaky....\n",
      "The vanilla flavor tastes and smells bad.  This product is loaded with cholesterol.  I can't recommend it.\n",
      "Dont waste money on this it is nasty and doesnt even come with a scooper\n",
      "This is literally how the product got sent to me. Opened by who knows! Seal broke and the contents spilled everywhere. Just poor buisness. Sad\n",
      "It says that each serving is $.75 but this is wrong. There are only 6 packets in the box making each serving >$3 each!\n",
      "Best flavor of any protein shake, hands down!  I love the little cookie pieces in it, too- once I figured out what they were!I don't understand people who say it doesn't mix well- throw it in a shaker cup with ice and water and shake it until blended - where's the mystery?Great powder!  Expensive, but great!\n",
      "Has ok flavor but does not mix thoroughly in the water and ends up being chunky.  The Adkins shakes are much better tasting and ready to drink.  I won't buy this again.\n",
      "I usually will have one of these shakes in the morning for breakfasts, but after having so many, the flavor became hard to stomach. I had gotten this container on sale after running out of the chocolate flavor and while the flavor was alright in the beginning, it got old very quick and I longed for it to be finished. Would not buy this flavor again.\n",
      "This lean shake it’s just way to sweet and unfortunately it didn’t settle well with my stomach..  I didn’t like the flavor ..\n",
      "this stuff tastes great just like chocolate milk and its not chalky or thick like most protein shakes. wish it wasnt so pricey but i guess the quality is worth it.\n",
      "I will make this short and sweet.  I love thin mints and I’ve been looking for a meal replacement so I figure this should knock out 2 birds with one stone.  Well, it’s disgusting.  So bad I couldn’t even choke it down.  Everyone has different taste preferences but if you’re looking for a tasty meal replacement, please don’t waste your money.\n",
      "Adds that punch to the vanilla makes you want more.\n",
      "Expensive but it taste so good. Can’t believe you can lose weight drinking this shake that is so delicious and good for you at the same time.\n",
      "The GNC store closed that I used to go to.  I'm glad the Lean Shake is offered at Amazon.  I like the choc shake and add a tablespoon of peanut butter.  It's like a Reese's cup.\n",
      "This is one of the best protein shakes I have ever had.\n",
      "Good value for the money\n",
      "A ++++++\n",
      "Great taste, and works as a meal replacement\n",
      "Super sweet and delicious!\n",
      "I pay $19.99 at Walmart for 1.38 lbs. This is $49.99 for 1.83 lbs. Maybe an error. I do love the taste and I mix in a blender with fruit!\n",
      "Muy buen producto y me llegó a tiempo y en buena condiciones\n",
      "This protein powder tastes great, but if you just mix it with water it doesn’t really fill you up. I prefer to add a banana and almond milk. It becomes more of a shake and does fill me up for hours.\n",
      "The taste is bad.\n",
      "I've brought several of these powder lean shakes. And always choose this flavor my second best would be the cookie and cream.\n",
      "This is a great product and tastes good.gRADE b+\n",
      "I like this shake fine. Love that you can mix it with just water. It keeps me full for a while. Only complaint is that I liked the flavor of the rich chocolate more. I don't taste the peanut butter flavor in this one at all and it's less sweet.\n",
      "-I don't really taste the \"caramel cookie\" flavor, just pure sugar.  It is very sweet!  I did add a medium banana and a cup of fresh spinach, like I do with all my other shakes, and I've never had a banana make a shake overly sweet.  If you are into this, then perfect!  I'm going to try to add more spinach and maybe cinnamon to try to cut the sweetness.+The scooper is right on top and sits inside the top of the container too!  That was a HUGE plus since most of the time I am searching through powder trying to locate the scooper.-I knew about the serving size/amount when I made the purchase, but it's still disappointing.  I would love to find a good meal replacement that lasts me a month (30 servings) that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  I plan to only use this once every couple days to make it last a month.Not sure about making me feel full or have less general food cravings, but it definitely satisfies my sugar cravings!\n",
      "I was really looking forward to this shake but I did not like the fact that when I received it, the seal was all loose making me drop it while taking it out of the box. The lid was not closed tightly, and with no protective seal, I spilled the powder. It made me iffy on whether I should try it, but I should've read these past reviews. I did order other shakes from the same brand but different flavors and those came completely sealed which I find even more weird as to why this one didn't but I at least have a backup. Not sure if it's even returnable if I spilled some while unboxing it due to it not being sealed.\n",
      "I liked the flavor but the chunks of cookie in it were very odd because I kept thinking I was not mixing it well enough.\n",
      "Did they add more sugar to this recently? Seems like ever since they changed the design of the front, they also changed the ingredients or shall I say added to it. Now there is a total of 6g of sugar. I could have sworn the classic 25 had less sugar in it. Either way, I can actually taste the difference. It tastes much more sweet than before and that's why I'm taking off 2 stars.\n",
      "I have previous bought other lean protein shake supplies from GNC such as the peanut butter cup special time offer. It was very good. This product, however, is not my favorite by any means. There are chunks of coconut in the protein that makes it feel like I'm drinking pulp. The flavor already is not great. I usually put my protein in the blender to make sure it mixes well. The chunks in my drink still do not get small enough to not notice. It is very disturbing for a post-workout drink.\n",
      "The chocolate taste delicious. Will definitely buy another.\n",
      "It’s much thinner than the premixed bottles you buy, and has coconut flakes in it. I’m not a fan of chunks in my drinks. Mixing it with ice helps catch them and hold them back. It was just weird. The flavor isn’t bad, just seems different than the premixed bottles. I’ll probably buy the premixed bottles from now on.\n",
      "I have tried many different meal replacement shakes and this one is by far the best. Keeps you full and tastes like you want a shake to taste.\n",
      ".. the fact that they're always out of stock should tell you enough. I do wish the tub was fuller but I keep buying it anyways. Plus the fact that the scooper is always securely at the top & I don't have to become an archeologists to look for it...is appreciated!\n",
      "Package arrived with seal not intact and powder everywhere inside the packaging. Not worth it to ship back but would advise against this seller.\n",
      "Tastes great.  The coconut shavings are hard to get used to.\n",
      "We love trying new flavors, wish it had a little more flavor to it.\n",
      "Tastes great, filling for a meal replacement\n",
      "Didn't like the taste\n",
      "The picture is misleading.  I thought I was getting two canisters.\n",
      "I purchased this as a meal replacement and to up my protein intake.  The product tastes great, but that's all I can say positive about it.  There are better products on the market and the one thing that is a huge downfall is the scoop.  It's not round and creates a mess when trying to use.  I will not be purchasing this product again as I can find those with fewer calories and sugar that taste better and double the product for the same price.\n",
      "good price for amount.  flavor is good.  if you mix banana and chocolate it is awesome! Thankyou gnc for offering so many flavors\n",
      "Starving to death in about an hour, going back to Casein\n",
      "I have tried a lot of protein drinks in my day but this stuff is the worst. I'd give them \"0\" stars if it was possible. I quickly returned all three flavors.\n",
      "Mew\n",
      "I enjoy the rich chocolate shake. However, it is a bit expensive.\n",
      "I've lost 120 pounds in nine months while using this product. I don't feel hungry throughout the day and I have plenty of energy. I'm also a chocoholic so I get my chocolate fix which is an added bonus.\n",
      "👍\n",
      "lovely\n",
      "I wonder how much climate change could be adverted if companies just started packaging things accurately... Like we're too stupid to figure it out.  So much wasted plastic.With that said, the product is tasty.  I would order it again, however, I will first try and look for an alternative. I've seen other companies who give you more product for the similar price.\n",
      "I used this product as a breakfast replacement. I’m giving it 4 stars because personally I was able to make it to lunch without being so hungry I was ready to chew my own foot off. About 10 am I had a small snack (1/2 apple or mango or a stick of cheese)  When I ordered the GNC Lean Shake 25 I ordered the;  Mixed Berry powder 210 cal per 8-10 oz water. 10 oz of water makes it too thin and watery. As far as taste goes I’ll give it a 0. It is beyond nasty and there is nothing fruity about it. I plan to force myself to drink all of it because I can’t see wasting $40, but it makes me want to gag.  Cookies & Cream powder 200 cal per 8-10 oz water.  Taste wise I’ll give it a 4. It was very doable. Again though, 10 oz water makes it too watery tasting.  Banana Cream ready made shake in a 14 oz bottle. The ready made was 14 oz and 170 calories. As far as taste it is by far the best. I’ll give this one 10 stars. The bottles are super easy And have 14 oz as opposed to 8 oz and far less calories. All have 25g protein. However, the banana only has 3g fiber, the other two have 8g.\n",
      "Love it! But they raised the price so much, I’ll have to find another protein shake. I’m not happy.\n",
      "Ordered cookies and cream, was sent vanilla bean. Just a mistake, not a huge deal but the vanilla was disgusting. Hopefully cookies and cream is actually edible.\n",
      "Yummy and delicious\n",
      "Recommend mixing it with Gnc CLA waffle vanilla flavor. 11g of net carbs it’s a nice meal replacement. Keto friendly if you actually use it for breakfast. A little bit pricey however make sure you compare it from the bogo of gnc\n",
      "I used this for a protein shake for breakfast. It taste great. It curbs my hunger for hours.  I also add matcha tea and you don’t taste the matcha.  I would totally recommend.\n",
      "She lost weight so I’m thinking bout trying this\n",
      "This is worth every penny! It fills you up and seems to curb my appetite. Win Win!\n"
