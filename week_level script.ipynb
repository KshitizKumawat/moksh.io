It has also never caused an acne flare up for me and instead seems to calm my skin. \n",

I stopped all that thank goodness, and started to treat my skin gently. This has worked wayyy better than bouncing between products and trying new harsh scrubs every other week. I now treat my skin as if it is sensitive and have a true routine using just a few products.  This product is key to that, and I use it night and day and night to protect my skin and calm any redness and irritation. I would definitely recommend trying this product - even if you don't end up loving it for your face, its great to use on your hands (especially because I'm washing them so often now). Each tub lasts a crazy long time too so the price is worth it.\n",

After applying it the first night, I saw a difference right away. The redness gone and my lids wasn’t bumpy and dry.  The second day, I noticed my face was going back to normal. I’m very thankful for this product. It’s now my daily/night moisturizer. I’ll recommend this to anyone with dry or redness problems. It def helped my skin and now I’m going to buy try their other products. Thank you First Aid Beauty!!\n",

I don’t have acne but I get a few breakouts before menstruating which I thought was normal/hormonal. That’s probably still true but I have not had a single breakout in months! I first tried this moisturizer as a free sample and I immediately noticed a change in the hydration, texture, and reduced redness of my skin. I then decided to purchase the 2oz and the results have been consistent. I’m now purchasing the value size! I use it everywhere—face, elbows, knees, butt. My favorite thing about this product is that it does NOT leave skin oily/greasy. Your skin just absorbs it immediately and will not look glossy midday. I have combination skin so finding a good hydrating moisturizer is realllyyy hard (especially one that doesn’t leave skin dry and/or oily in some areas). I can’t say the same thing about other FAB products but this one is PERFECTION. I have never said this about a product but this will definitely be a lifetime product for me! I wish I could thank the creators directly lol. I hope this review helps! If it’s available as a sample (or even if it’s not) I suggest you try it!\n",

I was using a steroid cream that didn’t seem to get rid of the last few bumps my rash had, no moisturizer was working for my dry flaking hand skin and I was applying other creams I kid you not at LEAST 10 times a day to no avail. Fast forward. The remaining bumps where my eczema was are gone, the skin that was flaking and felt so incredibly rough and dry like leather now feels baby soft like the rest of my skin. This helps skin texture so much. I started this on my face too and I literally cannot say enough good stuff about it. It’s been weeks and I am not getting break outs on my face like I was before. I used to think I had oily skin but now I’m pretty sure I was just using the wrong products for my sensitive skin, AND YOU PROBABLY ARE TOO. This is worth trying, buy even the small one and do yourself a favor; if everything seems to break you out just try it and see. You really cannot beat the price point with this brand.\n",

It's a thick cream but very lightweight once you rub it in. I also like that this product is clean and contains very good ingredients. Lastly, this brand is vegan AND cruelty free! I understand that they recently started selling their products in China, a country that can require animal testing by law. HOWEVER, PETA has confirmed that the brand is working with Chinese companies who do not use animal testing, so unless more information comes out, I personally do not have a problem with supporting this brand.\n",

      "I primarily use a gel moisturizer during the day and wanted something richer as a nighttime moisturizer, and I gravitated towards this immediately because the first ingredient is colloidal oatmeal which is great for reducing irritation and soothing the skin, especially if you have eczema prone skin which I do. However my skin doesn't react well if I use creams that are too heavy either which creates a dilemma for me but this product is amazing at balancing both concerns. I noticed after a few uses that I would wake up with brighter and calmer skin! Overall my skin tone seemed more even and my skin can act up with changes in the weather but it really felt like this cream was repairing and healing my skin. It has a rich consistency but doesn't feel too heavy and didn't break me out and while I tend to like fragrance in skincare I appreciate that this is fragrance free as that is gentler for the skin. For the price, this is definitely well worth it and I would recommend!\n",

It soaks into my skin quickly, I get almost no oiliness throughout the day (with the addition of a niacinamide serum), and the flakiness is gone. I have recommended this cream to all of my family and friends who now also love it. Great price for an amazing product <3\n",

I have dry skin but not to the point where its flaky, the smallest amount is more than enough, if you have drier skin use a little more. it feels so smooth on the skin and has no fragrance so its just all around perfect. It says it helps with rosacia and I can confirm it did help my skin, my cheeks are noticeably less red, I cannot speak for others but it did help my skin. The bigger tub is so worth the money, you will get more than what you paid for.\n",

After the first use I saw a significant change and my forehead issue - gone .  I’m not a fan of the smell (hence 4 stars instead of 5) , but it works ! It’s thick enough to rub into skin , but doesn’t leave any greasiness or after affect to your skin/hands. I love it and as long as it keeps working for my skin I’ll continue to purchase !\n",

I put it on before bed and when I woke up my skin had never been so soft, smooth, and clear. I finally found something that would mattify my skin without drying. I was THRILLED. Until...I bought this product again and it felt completely different. Did they change the formula? If so, they did not make this very clear and I felt duped! My pores starting clogging like crazy and my skin felt greasy again and not that soft matte feeling that I had been trying to achieve for YEARS with tons of products! To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. This no longer has the soft whipped feeling that I loved. Back to the drawing board....\n",

When I first used it, I woke up to little bumps ALL over my face, which has never happened to me before. I think it might have been a reaction to the eucalyptus oil (which gives off a pretty strong scent). I kept using the moisturizer, and the bumps did go away after about 1-2 weeks.

      "I bought the limited edition size Spring sale with high hopes because of all the great reviews. I am a skin care junkie. I have fair skin and I'm starting to get fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead. I didn't expect this to do more than just hydrate, but I think that with it being to thick that it does a great job of plumping my fine lines so that they are less noticeable. I also wanted something that wouldn't flare up my skin. I have sensitive skin which is only exacerbated by the sun here where I live. I found it soothing, but I think I would only use it in my house or at night, but when it gets hot and I start to perspire, it feels like its sitting on top of my skin and its a weird feeling. Anyway, I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because although I love the product, it's not something I can wear all day. This would work great in the winter months though.\n",

I thought this would be too thick under makeup but it works as a day and night moisturizer and look good under makeup. Definitely the best value product I got! This is going to last forever. This is the perfect moisturizer for me because I have dry combination skin. This didn't make me oily in the T zone and also kept my dry patches moisturized all day. Give this a try!

Every product I used didn’t keep my skin hydrated, and some even caused contact dermatitis that would cause red blotchy patches on my skin that would burn and not go away for 2-3 weeks. My skin has completely transformed only after a few uses of this product. My skin stays hydrated, and super soft all day long. I couldn’t be anymore pleased with this product. Being able to also use it on body such as my legs and feet to keep them soft is just an added bonus. Thank you so much First Aid Beauty.\n",

It never breaks me out, it gets absorbed quickly and doesn't leave me feeling sticky or oily, it doesn't smell like anything, and I love that all the ingredients are safe and clean.

I have been using it for about 6 months and have noticed that my skin has been hydrated and did not have any breakouts or other issues because of it. My only complaint is the smell. I thought it would be odorless, but it definitely has a smell. My boyfriend complains to me when he smells it on my face. It smells like old soap. And I thought it was a bad batch, but even the cleanser I have from FAB has the same smell. I will be trying another moisturizer, but if all else fails I would buy this product again.\n",

I and dry/combo, and I use this as my morning and night moisturizer. I buy 6oz jars at a time and they last me months. I was tired of paying 40/50/60 dollars for 1.7oz. This helps clear my redness (rosacea) and keeps me moisturizer. If I am using lots or acids or feel dry, I supplement with Laneige cream skin refiner (but any moisturizing toner would do). I will never go back, but I admit the product does sting sometimes. I suspect the stinging comes from the niacinamide, as I have a similar reaction when I use the TO niacinamide. The stinging goes away and my skin looks great with this product.\n",

      "I have dry skin but I breakout every now and then, and I am insecure about the texture. I swear by prescription retinoid cream because it works great for me and because I'm super faithful to it, I needed a moisturizer to combat the dryness. I also suffer from contact dermatitis so I am very paranoid about what can cause a reaction on my face. This moisturizer is great if you are trying to avoid any potential irritants. It also ranks pretty high on the Environmental Working Group's ingredients scan.  It feels so good to have a lotion for dry skin that is good at serving its purpose, no extra fluff and ingredients you don't need. I will say...if you suffer from dryness, you could find a thicker lotion than this, but I prefer to apply layers throughout the day than opt for something that can potentially irritate my skin. Since you can apply this anywhere, I take the extra and rub into my hands and elbows. It really does soothe my temporary irritations from the retinoid uglies. I love this brand for prioritizing clean beauty.\n",

I started bumping up the quantity I used and wow- it delivered on its claims. I use this nightly after toning and a serum. I use about two tablespoons to coat my entire face. I really slather it on and allow it to sink in. The result is super hydrated, bright, calm and happy skin. Each container lasts a few months of nightly use. I typically wait until it’s on sale and then stock up, thus justifying my heavy usage and the price. Regardless, you get a ton of product and it works well. If you have extremely dry and sensitive skin like me, give this product a try. Just be aware that you may need to use more than you’re accustomed to.\n",

But he couldn’t go off them coz he was in his final two weeks of nicotine patches and this was a new brand that was giving him a severe reaction. So after the second night I put this on his red round patches and the next morning they were gone. The moment I put it on his skin just drank it all up. It was unbelievable. Now with the covid19 and both of us always excessively hand washing and sanitizing, our skin has been cracking and dry and super itchy. So this is our go to cream first thing in the morning and last thing at night. \n",

Anyone who uses acids on the regular knows it’s something you have to build your skin up to using, and even when your skin is used to it- irritation can occur. I was blown away when I put this cream on my face and it felt so soothing, and took away the redness! \n",

      "I received this product at my local Sephora store as a free sample with a purchase I made.

My skin was a little mad from all the deep pore cleansing. \n",

      "I put this on my face and was wowed. The texture is whipped,creamy and luxurious and even putting it on my fingers, I was really impressed. My skin calmed /instantly/. It was thick and incredibly hydrating and I could immediately see why it was called an ultra repair cream. It was scent free, which I loved, and made my skin feel soft, dewy and refreshed. I'm blown away that this isn't even considered a 'night' cream, as those tend to be a bit thicker. I'm also blown away that you can use it all over your body!\n",

It doesn’t cause my face to break out and it heals the cracked skin on my hands.  My only criticism is the seal on the tub.  Tubs are fine, but I could not get the seal off!  My nails are also very dry and they were flexing as I tried to pull up the tabs to rip off the safety seal, so I finally had to get pliers, which really backfired because the foil came up but the clear membrane did not, so it ripped in half and I got this precious cream all over my hands - way more than I needed and I didn’t want to put it back in the tub, even though my hands were clean.\n",

      "I’m an elementary school teacher, so I’m constantly using hand sanitizer and washing my hands throughout the day...my hands get very dry, irritated, and flaky as a result.  I have bottles and tubes of the B&BW lotions all over my classroom, and while they smell nice, they do absolutely nothing to effectively moisturize my skin.  Once I started using this, I could truly notice the difference to my hands.  It’s a little thicker than other products, but quickly absorbs into the skin...definitely gives me noticeable results.  I usually purchase the 8 oz. size which comes in a tube, and recently tried to reorder but noticed that Sephora doesn’t currently offer it...I hope this is just a temporary thing.  Not only is it a much better value on an already pricey item, but I just hate the thought of digging my fingers into the 6 oz. jar...the “germaphobe” in me just thinks that so unhygienic.  Please bring back the 8 oz. tube soon!\n",

Before I got this, Michigan winters were so hard on my skin and I could not find anything that helped my dry flaky patches on my forehead and cheeks. I was so self conscious about it and I couldn't even wear makeup because it looked so bad! I noticed a difference with this moisturizer immediately and love that even though it's thick it sinks into your skin so effortlessly. When I ran out last week I started using a different one until I could restock and within a day my skin was back to its old ways and was soo angry!!

I am usually acne prone with red scarring (mostly hormonal and stress induced) along with horrible dry patches on my cheeks and nose. My skin is now very smooth and soft because of this moisturizer. It does not clog my pores or cause breakouts and is very soothing. I also use it on my hands and occasionally my legs!\n",

      "I enjoy this cream in that it goes on smoothly, is not greasy, and seems to sink right into my dry skin.  It has a faint, pleasant scent.  It does not irritate my skin at all.  It's not as thick going on as it looks/feels and spreads nicely, and actually leaves my skin feeling about the same until it has some time to work.  In about 10 minutes my skin feels moisturized.  The reason for 4 stars is that I would in no way consider this to be \"intensely hydrating.\"  It's calming and moisturizing enough, but nothing intense about it.  I also hate that it is in a tub - that's just annoying packaging.\n",

      "I have acne prone skin. Very acne prone skin. Most of it is hormonal - but I’ve been struggling with it for years. I also have pretty combination skin, I’m not always very dry but I’m not always oily either. During the winter months, my skin flakes underneath my makeup like crazy. My skin will feel moisturized and I put my makeup on and suddenly my skin is flaming everywhere and looks disgusting. \n",

      "This moisturizer changed the game. I won’t use anything else now. I feel so sorry for those who said it makes them break out because I’ve had nothing but a great experience with this moisturizer. I think that’s a true testament to say that everyone reacts differently to things. Even after using a cleanser one day that was too much for my skin, this moisturizer soothed my skin like no other. I can’t believe I didn’t hear about this earlier!!! I always thought using heavy moisturizers was the key to curing dry skin, if you use a little bit, this feels light AND moisturizes your skin like no other. Will never use another product!\n",

      "Seriously, buy the big one. You won't regret it. I cannot get enough of this moisturizer. I would buy this by the barrel if I could. I've been using this as a daily moisturizer for years now. I use it on my face and body. For my face I typically just use it at night as it is a heavier moisturizer and use FAB's face specific moisturizer in the morning. But on days I think I really need the extra hydration I'll use it in the morning as well. My skin is incredibly sensitive and this not only moisturizes, sinks in fast, and wears well under makeup...it also calms my skin after iritation! Weather it's a new skin care product that burns, new laundry soap that itches, dry hands from hospital sanitizers, or an allergic reaction, I know this moisturizer will calm and soothe my skin.\n",

I have oily and sensitive skin, so finding a winter face moisturizer, in particular, that is occlusive but not greasy/heavy feeling is tricky. This is the best I've found. The texture is more whipped than just plain thick and heavy, which I love. I know there is eucalyptus leaf oil in it, so it's not completely free of potentially irritating botanical ingredients, but it's pretty far down on the list. I've never experienced any irritation when using this. Highly recommend.\n",

When I tried it on my face last night, I immediately felt a light burning sensation. This was odd for 2 reasons: first, this has never happened to me with any moisturizer before and second, this is specifically a “healing” cream. It turns out that the last ingredient, eucalyptus leaf extract, can cause sensitivity in some people and I just happen to be one of them. However, it promotes good oil production so if you have truly dry skin and don’t have a sensitivity to eucalyptus, this could be for you!\n",

This lotion keeps my skin hydrated all day/night and isn't too thick or greasy. I also pair this lotion with the Ordinary hyaluronic acid serum before I add the lotion and that helps a ton too!\n",

      "first aid beauty ultra repair cream helped calm and soothe my atopic dermatitis. my skin felt less itchy and angry after using this. i'm still itchy, but not as much. the only drawbacks were that this was not moisturizing enough for my severely dry atopic dermatitis skin on my face and neck plus it tends to pill. this moisturized my skin without feeling greasy or oily, but i could feel a tackiness or residue on top of my skin -- not exactly a smooth feeling. it worked fine on my hands and body.\n",

      "\n",
      "I recently went for my first full makeover at Sephora, and the artist used this moisturizer on my face before applying makeup. I have sensitive skin with rosacea and I had washed my face with water that was too warm right before arriving at Sephora, so my face was super red and blotchy. Once this moisturizer was applied, it almost immediately calmed down my complexion and cleared it up. My sister was with me, and she was amazed at how my face transformed so completely and quickly right before her eyes as she looked at me! Of course I bought this and I've been using it nightly. I even stopped using my prescription rosacea cream because using this on its own does a much better job at keeping my skin soft and even. I've used it on my legs, arms, etc., as well and it's great at moisturizing any area very quickly. I'm a customer of this product for life!\n",
