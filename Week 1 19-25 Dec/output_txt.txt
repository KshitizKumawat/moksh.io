Great even if you have acne
I have combination acne prone skin and was searching for a daily moisturizer that would help protect my skin and also not cause more pimples. This is the one. Its on the heavier side, which I would normally shy away from, but this cream absorbs very well into my skin, leaving it feeling calm and soft. It has also never caused an acne flare up for me and instead seems to calm my skin. 
Before using this product my face was a mess of volcanic acne eruptions, complete with dark acne scars. "Skin care" for me meant scrubbing my face a thousand times a day and using every face mask under the sun. I stopped all that thank goodness, and started to treat my skin gently. This has worked wayyy better than bouncing between products and trying new harsh scrubs every other week. I now treat my skin as if it is sensitive and have a true routine using just a few products.  This product is key to that, and I use it night and day and night to protect my skin and calm any redness and irritation. I would definitely recommend trying this product - even if you don't end up loving it for your face, its great to use on your hands (especially because I'm washing them so often now). Each tub lasts a crazy long time too so the price is worth it.##ENDING##

Review for tube version
Skin is [dry, sensitive, combination]
Environment is [humid - Hawaii]
Age is [35] 
Full Time Working Single Mom Health Care Professional, not living with parents (so the stress ya know what i mean)

I prefer the tube version because it just seems much cleaner to me. I have been using all types of skin care for 10+ years--always looking for the best one for my situation--and I always begrudgingly come back to this moisturizer. If  I'm reacting badly to a new product (i like to try new products that are considered "clean") like suddenly i develop fungal acne or my skin starts to look a bit dull or there are dry spots, etc. then i switch back to this moisturizer and my skin looks happy again. I am a huge believer in washing properly, moisturizing, and sunscreen and although genetics are big factor, please believe me when i say i feel like those things help too. [Be consistent!]

Miracle in a Jar!!
My new holy grail. I was having some type of reaction and couldn’t figure what it was from. My lids were sand paper dry and some red bumpy patches on my face. I never had skin problems so it was driving me nuts. I even tried applying aloe plant but it was just sticky and messy. Read reviews on this product and thought “it won’t hurt to try”. After applying it the first night, I saw a difference right away. The redness gone and my lids wasn’t bumpy and dry.  The second day, I noticed my face was going back to normal. I’m very thankful for this product. It’s now my daily/night moisturizer. I’ll recommend this to anyone with dry or redness problems. It def helped my skin and now I’m going to buy try their other products. Thank you First Aid Beauty!!##ENDING##

no joke, changed my life
I never write reviews but I had to let you all know about how AMAZING this moisturizer has been to my skin!! I have never used anything like it. I don’t have acne but I get a few breakouts before menstruating which I thought was normal/hormonal. That’s probably still true but I have not had a single breakout in months! I first tried this moisturizer as a free sample and I immediately noticed a change in the hydration, texture, and reduced redness of my skin. I then decided to purchase the 2oz and the results have been consistent. I’m now purchasing the value size! I use it everywhere—face, elbows, knees, butt. My favorite thing about this product is that it does NOT leave skin oily/greasy. Your skin just absorbs it immediately and will not look glossy midday. I have combination skin so finding a good hydrating moisturizer is realllyyy hard (especially one that doesn’t leave skin dry and/or oily in some areas). I can’t say the same thing about other FAB products but this one is PERFECTION. I have never said this about a product but this will definitely be a lifetime product for me! I wish I could thank the creators directly lol. I hope this review helps! If it’s available as a sample (or even if it’s not) I suggest you try it!##ENDING##

BUY THIS NOW
If you don’t already have this, do not hesitate. It’s amazing. I have sensitive dry/combo skin. And my skin is obsessed with this. I’ve had it for a few months now. It’s thick and hydrating. I literally use it every night (it’s too heavy for a morning moisturizer IMO). The second I put it on it feels thick and luxurious. I don’t feel like I need to layer another product on for more hydration like I usually do (was using laneige water cream for a year before I realized it was drying my skin more than hydrating it). And when I wake up my skin feels plumb and hydrated. 

- I have pcos so I wax my face every few weeks. I used to use tea tree salve and witch hazel after waxing but now I use this( after washing my face of course). I feel like the next morning my skin has less redness and irritation. No bumps or acne from waxing. It’s a miracle in a jar. I will forever use this. Buy buy buy. #holygrail##ENDING##

do yourself a favor and try it
I suffer from adult acne as well as dyshidrotic eczema (basically an allergic reaction to beauty products / specifically soaps and scents so my skin freaks out by creating little bubbles under the skin ) totally bought this on a whim. I was using a steroid cream that didn’t seem to get rid of the last few bumps my rash had, no moisturizer was working for my dry flaking hand skin and I was applying other creams I kid you not at LEAST 10 times a day to no avail. Fast forward. The remaining bumps where my eczema was are gone, the skin that was flaking and felt so incredibly rough and dry like leather now feels baby soft like the rest of my skin. This helps skin texture so much. I started this on my face too and I literally cannot say enough good stuff about it. It’s been weeks and I am not getting break outs on my face like I was before. I used to think I had oily skin but now I’m pretty sure I was just using the wrong products for my sensitive skin, AND YOU PROBABLY ARE TOO. This is worth trying, buy even the small one and do yourself a favor; if everything seems to break you out just try it and see. You really cannot beat the price point with this brand.##ENDING##

NEW HOLY GRAIL
I bought this cream because I started watching a lot of skincare by Hyram, and he recommended it in one of his videos. Also I've been trying to transition from my former holy grail moisturizer (the ole henriksen vitamin c gel creme), because that product contains a lot of citrus extracts/fragrance which can be very irritating to the skin.
First off, you get SO MUCH product for the price. There are moisturizers at sephora that are less than a THIRD of the size of this product for like the same price or way more. A little goes a long way, I use about a dime sized amount of product every morning and night on my face and neck. 
I love the fact that this product contains oat. It really calms my skin down and I see the redness in my skin diminish. Even though i have combo skin, it doesn't make me super oily. It's a thick cream but very lightweight once you rub it in. I also like that this product is clean and contains very good ingredients. Lastly, this brand is vegan AND cruelty free! I understand that they recently started selling their products in China, a country that can require animal testing by law. HOWEVER, PETA has confirmed that the brand is working with Chinese companies who do not use animal testing, so unless more information comes out, I personally do not have a problem with supporting this brand.##ENDING##

Best moisturizer out there!
I've was struggling with a damaged moisture barrier for over two weeks after over-treating my skin. I did everything I could to soothe and fix my skin but it always felt tight and dry even if it didn't look awful. I gave this a shot and I instantly felt changed. I used it day and night for about a week and my moisture barrier was completely healed. I've started using it only at night now because it really is a heavy cream even for my dry skin throughout the day. Honestly, though, I think this is my holy grail when it comes to moisturizers.##ENDING##

Skin Really Feels Repaired
I primarily use a gel moisturizer during the day and wanted something richer as a nighttime moisturizer, and I gravitated towards this immediately because the first ingredient is colloidal oatmeal which is great for reducing irritation and soothing the skin, especially if you have eczema prone skin which I do. However my skin doesn't react well if I use creams that are too heavy either which creates a dilemma for me but this product is amazing at balancing both concerns. I noticed after a few uses that I would wake up with brighter and calmer skin! Overall my skin tone seemed more even and my skin can act up with changes in the weather but it really felt like this cream was repairing and healing my skin. It has a rich consistency but doesn't feel too heavy and didn't break me out and while I tend to like fragrance in skincare I appreciate that this is fragrance free as that is gentler for the skin. For the price, this is definitely well worth it and I would recommend!##ENDING##

I'm an oily skin girl but I use prescription retinol nightly causing my skin to also get flakey.

After a never ending parade of skincare products for YEARS I finally found a great moisturizer that’s it.

I cannot say enough good things about this product. It's the most moisturizing cream, actually healing I had some bad break outs and im convinced this cream helped clear it up. I have dry skin but not to the point where its flaky, the smallest amount is more than enough, if you have drier skin use a little more. it feels so smooth on the skin and has no fragrance so its just all around perfect. It says it helps with rosacia and I can confirm it did help my skin, my cheeks are noticeably less red, I cannot speak for others but it did help my skin. The bigger tub is so worth the money, you will get more than what you paid for.##ENDING##

an overall great moisturizer
came across this product back in 2016 when I was going through a bout of intense acne. my skin was severely damaged, sore, red. as sensitive as things could get. this was the only product i could use that didn't cause discomfort to my skin or worsen the condition. this product didn't fix the issue, but it aided in protecting and nourishing my damaged moisture barrier without exacerbating any more acne. in 2018 i had another bout of the same skin issue and turned to this product after trying several other products. and same results - it was the only product that didn't sensitize my skin further. it's almost like my go to product when my skin needs some gentle but effective moisturizing.

now that my skin is not damaged, i still use this just to get rid of the product (not the same jar / tube, but it has a great shelf life). i've realized that this product is actually great for my normal/combo skin. it moisturizes deeply without leaving a greasy / shiny look. and that same deeply nourished feeling (which might feel heavy for some) lasts ALL day - without making my skin look nor feel greasy. 

the amount you use is important along with how you use it. it locks in moisture very well - but you have to implement moisture (with a liquid product) first and then seal it with this product. i used to use a pea sized amount, which wasn't enough. now i use like, 3 peas of amount and that's PERFECT for my face and neck. it's a good, standard moisturizer that can fit well with all products. 

i just don't think you can wrong with this product. im now making it my permanent moisturizer rather than my "SOS" moisturizer. it does what it claims, and it's just such well formulated "simple" moisturizer##ENDING##

Good for sensitive skin, not enough for dry skin
I am dealing with fungal acne and rosacea at the same time. First, this product is not safe for fungal acne. I don't know it before, luckily, it didn't break my skin out. The smell is very light, I'm good with that. The texture made me think it's heavyweight on my skin, but it's not. I intended to buy it for body use but end of the day, I used it for my face and it works well.

I don't know why but sometimes, I apply it after B5 serum, it's a little bit stinging but that sensation will go after after 2-3 mins. And, it's good for oily sensitive skin but not enough for super dry sensitive skin.##ENDING##

Healed my skin!
I have Normal to oily skin and about a month ago since we are in quarantine I over exfoliated my skin. My skin was very damaged! The skin around  my mouth was bright red, peeling and cracking. This got rid of the redness and peeling immediately! My skin was like that for a month and aquafor did not help at all! This is cheap and it works! I would recommend this to those on accutane as well! It also works amazing as a moisturizer for my skin type as it absorbs into the skin not leaving me greasy. 10/10##ENDING##

My skin is extremely dry . I’ve tried numerous brands in different price ranges and nothing has done the job all the way . I thought I had finally found a brand that worked for me , but my forehead was still flaking and dry . I went into the Sephora seeking some help and was recommended this one . It has worked wonders ! After the first use I saw a significant change and my forehead issue - gone .  I’m not a fan of the smell (hence 4 stars instead of 5) , but it works ! It’s thick enough to rub into skin , but doesn’t leave any greasiness or after affect to your skin/hands. I love it and as long as it keeps working for my skin I’ll continue to purchase !##ENDING##

Did they change the formula??
I received sample packets of the FAB ultra repair cream intense hydration last year. I have combination skin, and it's on the thicker side (on my face) so it sometimes has trouble soaking in moisturizers. Anyway, I tried these samples and was AMAZED. I put it on before bed and when I woke up my skin had never been so soft, smooth, and clear. I finally found something that would mattify my skin without drying. I was THRILLED. Until...I bought this product again and it felt completely different. Did they change the formula? If so, they did not make this very clear and I felt duped! My pores starting clogging like crazy and my skin felt greasy again and not that soft matte feeling that I had been trying to achieve for YEARS with tons of products! To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. This no longer has the soft whipped feeling that I loved. Back to the drawing board....##ENDING##

##P4R675

I normally use Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion because it's a nice basic moisturizer that doesn't break me out, but it wasn't quite hydrating enough, so I decided to try this one out. When I first used it, I woke up to little bumps ALL over my face, which has never happened to me before. I think it might have been a reaction to the eucalyptus oil (which gives off a pretty strong scent). I kept using the moisturizer, and the bumps did go away after about 1-2 weeks. But I don't know why a product marketed for sensitive skin would have essential oils in it - they can be irritating to a lot of people, especially those with sensitive skin.

I use this cream after my Laneige Cream Skin Toner & Moisturizer because the cream is very thick and doesn't penetrate deeply into my skin. It's fine, and I will use it up because I don't like wasting products, but I definitely won't be repurchasing this.##ENDING##

Purchased for my daughter who had this eczema Spot on one side of her cheek.   I decided to try this based on product description and helpful reviews.  It’s working—that dry patch is fading!

Eczema
I've had eczema (stress-related) on my hands for a few years now but recently it's been on my face! Horrible itchy dryness on either sides of my chin, my typical face moisturizer wasn't helping.  After FOUR different brands and FOUR months later (I gave all a full month for my face to adjust and see changes... there was none) I gave this a shot.  After a full month of use I can confidently say it saved my face from more pain. Biggest advantage of this product is that it can be used on both face and body!

I absolutely love this product but now with summer coming up fast I'm wondering if it'll be too thick and oily for daily use. Let's hope I can use it all year long!##ENDING##

Great for all!
I LOVE this moisturizer. Recently my skin has switched from oily to normal/dry, and I was struggling to find something that would give me enough moisture without making me break out. I also live in a very dry place, and so my skin was suffering a lot. This has saved me! Not only has my skin not broken out (minus a bit of hormonal acne) it hasn’t instigated any of the small bumps I used to get on my forehead, and has helped (along with their KP scrub) the bumps on my arms. I use this am/pm and my skin feels great. There’s no leftover residue. I had my mother try this as well, she deals with aging and sensitive skin, and she’s now buying this in bulk!##ENDING##

this is my everyday moisturizer, I use it day and night. I am lucky enough to have good skin, I'm 26, and although I have hormonal acne my skin has always been relatively clear.  The past year I've had eczema on my face, and no idea what the cause is. this moisturizer has really helped to calm and hydrate my skin. I won't say that this itself has cures my eczema, because it didn't, but it definitely helped keep my skin well hydrated to help combat it.

Holy Grail Moisturizer!
I LOVE this stuff. I've been using it for 1 year. I have combination skin so I need to be careful to hydrate well but with something that absorbs quickly so I don't get excess oil production. I use this as a 2x a day moisturizer in the winter but I only use it at night in the summer. It absorbs quickly and I love how emollient it is. It's also great as a spot treatment for dry patches on the body. I get some flaky skin in the winter and this fixes it immediately. I used to use the Drunk Elephant Lala Retro ($$$) and switched to this to save money. Honestly, they work the same!##ENDING##

ideal for night time
Pretty good, bought this initially because I have dry skin. The only problem I see that happens is that when I apply this under my sunscreen moisturizer, it clumps up. This is probably due to differences in formula. I will have to opt to using only one moisturizer at a time bc this one does not like to mix. 
I do like  the consistency and it does seem to hydrate well. It’s my first time using this so I will have to keep using it for a longer time to make a better review. It smells a bit like beef which is not a problem to me as I used to love beef (not anymore I’m vegetarian) and is otherwise a pleasant product.##ENDING##

goodbye bumps and dry skin
This stuff is amazing! I have very dry skin and struggle with kp on my arm and on my jawline. I’ve used tons of high end products that would help, but not fully get rid of the bumps. I decided that I would try this by mixing a little in with my drunk elephant moisturizer and face oil to make them last longer (my birdie goes, “cheap-cheap”) I am now obsessed! My face hasn’t been this clear in years! I would definitely try using a little bit mixed with another moisturizer if you want to use it on your face because it’s INCREDIBLY thick and can clog your pours. I initially got the 2 oz size just for my face, but now I’m getting the value tub! If you struggle with really dry skin, give it a go!!! Good luck!##ENDING##

Struggling with painful dryness? Get this!
Okay so, I was "going through it" as the kids say, and I ended up using 80% of my new tissue box to wipe my nose. In addition, I wiped it with stiff 2-ply toilet paper beforehand for like 30 minutes. My nose was so sore and raw it looked like I just got beat up. The next day, it was stinging and super dry, and I decided to use this on my nose throughout the day. A day and a half of peeling off dead dry skin later, this stuff healed my nose verrrry nicely! It also keeps my eczema at bay when I dont have the cream with me.

Lives up to the hype!
I bought the limited edition size Spring sale with high hopes because of all the great reviews. I am a skin care junkie. I have fair skin and I'm starting to get fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead. I didn't expect this to do more than just hydrate, but I think that with it being to thick that it does a great job of plumping my fine lines so that they are less noticeable. I also wanted something that wouldn't flare up my skin. I have sensitive skin which is only exacerbated by the sun here where I live. I found it soothing, but I think I would only use it in my house or at night, but when it gets hot and I start to perspire, it feels like its sitting on top of my skin and its a weird feeling. Anyway, I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because although I love the product, it's not something I can wear all day. This would work great in the winter months though.##ENDING##

A big NO for me
I’m very disappointed. I thought this would give me great hydration and it’s doing the complete opposite. My nose and forehead is peeling like crazy and around my acne is flaky which hasn’t happened in a long time.

I have been using this product for YEARS and it continues to amaze me. I have acne prone, dry skin and this works perfectly without breaking me out. I use it morning and night in combination with my acne products. This never fails to hydrate my skin and doesn’t feel oily or greasy. I can confidently say it has drastically improved the texture of my skin. Definitely worth purchasing.##ENDING##

never want anything else
I’m white, and my skin tends towards the dry ruddy side of things. I’ve used this moisturizer for years, and have never been tempted away from it by any other product or sample. I just bought my fifth 6.0 oz tub of it. I love it, it’s not fragranced or irritating, feels clean on my skin, absorbs quickly, and doesn’t make me break out. I put it on my face, neck, chest, and then rub the excess on my elbows. For Sephora the price is reasonable and 6 oz lasts me six months. Can’t recommend highly enough.##ENDING##

Great, But Not Holy Grail
Overall, I enjoyed this moisturizer. It is lightweight, not greasy, and deeply hydrating. Makeup sat really nicely on top of it, better than with my usual everyday moisturizer. I am rating it a 4/5 because it is an "intense hydration" cream, but I felt like I needed another layer a couple of hours later -- which I do not need with my usual everyday moisturizer. I think it is a great option, but not replacing my holy grail.##ENDING##

MEhhh!
Not that great. I got the 6oz one, it says "intense hydration" but I found myself using it again and again after every couple of hours. I used this for about a month and saw little tiny bumps on my skin everywhere especially on my forehead which I did not have before, as soon as I stopped using it in a matter of days my skin was back to normal. Just because it was expensive I want to make use of it so I might use it as a body lotion but I am scared I will get bumpy skin everywhere else. I don't know what I'm going to do with this smh!! No good things came out of this##ENDING##

Amazing Moisturizer
I was hesitant to get this moisturizer because I thought it was only for seriously dry skin based on the description BUT it is an amazing product and works great for my skin. I use it only at night and I wake up to fresh and hydrated skin every morning. I pair this with Drunk Elephant’s hydration serum. It also is huge so will last a long time and is not insanely expensive like some other moisturizers at Sephora. Honestly like this better than Drunk Elephant’s protini moisturizer which I used before purchasing this.##ENDING##

Perfect Moisturizer
I got the limited edition FAB AID size 8 oz and the tub is huge! It's as big as a jar for lotion. This is my favorite thing I purchased during the Spring Sale. The hydration cream is very thick when you scoop it out but once on the skin it melts right in and feels like water. I thought this would be too thick under makeup but it works as a day and night moisturizer and look good under makeup. Definitely the best value product I got! This is going to last forever. This is the perfect moisturizer for me because I have dry combination skin. This didn't make me oily in the T zone and also kept my dry patches moisturized all day. Give this a try! Great value and great product!##ENDING##

This stuff is great for my crazy dry skin. It's my favorite daily moisturizer so far.

I'm very happy with this and will recommend it to most anyone.##ENDING##

This is the best moisturizer I’ve ever used!! I’ve been on accutane for months now and this moisturizer is the only thing saving my dry skin. Usually people’s biggest complaint about accutane is the dryness that comes with it, but I use this moisturizer twice a day (morning and night) and I don’t have dry skin at all!! Before I used to flake and peel but now, my skin is so soft and smooth and literally no dryness at all. Sometimes I forget I’m on accutane lol##ENDING##

Great for tired, dry skin!
I purchased a mini size of this cream with some points I had saved up.

I have a nervous tic where I pick at the skin on the side of my thumb. The skin in that area has been red, dry and continuously scabbed over from healing and broken again over the years. I have tried numerous creams and ointments to help it go back to how it was before to no avail.

This stuff has done the trick. After a month of use, the skin has softened and the redness is almost gone. It also does not dry up and peel like it used to.

The only reason I gave this cream 4 stars is because it has a scent (a very, VERY light mint scent, almost like a sweet vapor rub) and does have a little oily residue, so it's not for large area use, just specific areas you need a little extra help in.##ENDING##

The reviews are real
I was contemplating purchasing Tatcha Dewy Skin face lotion when I came across this cream. This $30 cream was half the price and had better reviews so I decided to give it a try. I live in Florida and I've been having dry patches of skin around my nose that I couldn't seem to get rid off. After using this lotion about 2-3x a day for 2 days, the dry patches have disappeared completely! wow, this stuff is amazing! It doesn't have a scent and it's not too thick. I highly recommend and would be purchasing again!##ENDING##

MIRACLE IN A TUB
THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFE SAVER. After taking Accutane to heal my cystic acne, I was left with clear, but severely dry, flaky, rough, patchy skin. Every product I used didn’t keep my skin hydrated, and some even caused contact dermatitis that would cause red blotchy patches on my skin that would burn and not go away for 2-3 weeks. My skin has completely transformed only after a few uses of this product. My skin stays hydrated, and super soft all day long. I couldn’t be anymore pleased with this product. Being able to also use it on body such as my legs and feet to keep them soft is just an added bonus. Thank you so much First Aid Beauty.##ENDING##

DRY SKIN GAME CHANGER
I have tried EVERYTHING for my dry skin. My face would drink up my foundation, it was so dry. Yet, I've tried endless moisturizers from name brand to drug store. I have also tried oils and serums and I had no luck. I saw the great reviews on this and decided to give it a go. After the first day of use, I use it morning and night, I noticed a HUGE difference. It was amazing! On day 2 of use, I applied a full face of makeup and it didn't soak in! This cream is worth every penny.

Skin feels FANTASTIC
Wonderfully hydrating! I got this during stay-at-home orders- the stress of current events lead me to have a first-ever eczema patch pop up on my right cheek- this did MIRACLES on the dry spot. However, it was too thick for me to continue with on my face. I get the occasional pimple, I'm human, but I started getting gnarlier ones while I was using this.

Here's the thing - I love the idea of a fancy moisturizer (that most likely costs $50+) but that's completely unnecessary. This moisturizer is legit.

Great product, but has an odd smell
I switched to this product after going cruelty free and was very hesitant since I had been using my previous moisturizer for nearly a decade. I have been using it for about 6 months and have noticed that my skin has been hydrated and did not have any breakouts or other issues because of it. My only complaint is the smell. I thought it would be odorless, but it definitely has a smell. My boyfriend complains to me when he smells it on my face. It smells like old soap. And I thought it was a bad batch, but even the cleanser I have from FAB has the same smell. I will be trying another moisturizer, but if all else fails I would buy this product again.##ENDING##

great product, great value
I love this product. I love how cost efficient it is and I love how moisturizing it is, and how well it plays with other skincare products. I and dry/combo, and I use this as my morning and night moisturizer. I buy 6oz jars at a time and they last me months. I was tired of paying 40/50/60 dollars for 1.7oz. This helps clear my redness (rosacea) and keeps me moisturizer. If I am using lots or acids or feel dry, I supplement with Laneige cream skin refiner (but any moisturizing toner would do). I will never go back, but I admit the product does sting sometimes. I suspect the stinging comes from the niacinamide, as I have a similar reaction when I use the TO niacinamide. The stinging goes away and my skin looks great with this product.##ENDING##

Great if you are on retinoids or have dry skin.
I have dry skin but I breakout every now and then, and I am insecure about the texture. I swear by prescription retinoid cream because it works great for me and because I'm super faithful to it, I needed a moisturizer to combat the dryness. I also suffer from contact dermatitis so I am very paranoid about what can cause a reaction on my face. This moisturizer is great if you are trying to avoid any potential irritants. It also ranks pretty high on the Environmental Working Group's ingredients scan.  It feels so good to have a lotion for dry skin that is good at serving its purpose, no extra fluff and ingredients you don't need. I will say...if you suffer from dryness, you could find a thicker lotion than this, but I prefer to apply layers throughout the day than opt for something that can potentially irritate my skin. Since you can apply this anywhere, I take the extra and rub into my hands and elbows. It really does soothe my temporary irritations from the retinoid uglies. I love this brand for prioritizing clean beauty.##ENDING##

I love this moisturizer! I use it twice daily, morning and night, and it keeps my skin nice and hydrated. I have combination skin, and I do not find the cream heavy or oily.

Works well if I use a lot
When I first started using this product, it felt nice and soothing on my very dry skin, but I didn’t feel like it offered as much hydration as it claimed to. I started bumping up the quantity I used and wow- it delivered on its claims. I use this nightly after toning and a serum. I use about two tablespoons to coat my entire face. I really slather it on and allow it to sink in. The result is super hydrated, bright, calm and happy skin. Each container lasts a few months of nightly use. I typically wait until it’s on sale and then stock up, thus justifying my heavy usage and the price. Regardless, you get a ton of product and it works well. If you have extremely dry and sensitive skin like me, give this product a try. Just be aware that you may need to use more than you’re accustomed to.##ENDING##

This past winter was brutal to my skin and created new dry spots that I've never had before. My skin was so dry that it was flaking off my face, so I needed something thick and healing. I haven't had any flaking issues since I've started using this! Love it.##ENDING##

Can't beat it, especially for the price!
Loving this product!  Was a little skeptical after having used much pricier products on my face, but have fallen in love with this cream.

Best all over/all around cream
I love this cream SO much! Its hydrating without feeling heavy, waxy or greasy. It is kind to my sensitive skin. I use it head to toe. (my hubby even likes to use it.) I do miss the large squeeze bottle and would love a pump even more. reaching in the tub feels like a good way to contaminate it.

Effective hydration without feeling greasy
This was recommended to me by a Sephora employee and I have used this as my moisturizer since. I love the richness without the greasy feeling on my face when I use it. A little goes a long way and I can even use it in the summers without feeling like it’s weighing my skin down.

Creamy Cream
I really love the consistency, fragrance and feel of this cream. It has helped moisturize my body way better than so many other products I've used before. I typically apply after a shower.

the Fairy God Mother of repair creams.
Hands down the best repair cream. I got this as part of their 10 year anniversary little pouch which came with some cleansing pads and a primer I think. Didn’t use much of it coz I thought I’d save it for a trip coz of the travel size. 

I’m a surgeon and with all the hand washing and sanitizing my hands are always red and cracked and painful. This is my go to cream to help it heal. And I started it after I saw it’s effects on my husbands skin. 

How it all started is when my husband quit smoking, he went on those nicotine patches which gave him severe red burn marks. But he couldn’t go off them coz he was in his final two weeks of nicotine patches and this was a new brand that was giving him a severe reaction. So after the second night I put this on his red round patches and the next morning they were gone. The moment I put it on his skin just drank it all up. It was unbelievable. Now with the covid19 and both of us always excessively hand washing and sanitizing, our skin has been cracking and dry and super itchy. So this is our go to cream first thing in the morning and last thing at night. 

I wish it wasn’t this pricey but hey....... it gets the job done. I genuinely don’t know how people use this on their face unless their skin type is super dry or have eczema and such. This is an extremely healing but also extremely moisturizing cream. It’ll defo clog up my pores if I used it on my combination skin. All in all, my favourite body moisturizer ever. Work isn’t so painful anymore.##ENDING##

Amazing as a body moisturizer
I am obsessed with this product. I initially bought it to use as a facial moisturizer for my extremely dry skin. It works much better as a body/neck moisturizer because it is pretty heavy. After several weeks it started to make my skin more oily. It was too oily for my preference, it is extremely hydrating I still use it under my eye every once in a while.  Overall I absolutely recommend this moisturizer though.##ENDING##

Great Product but new seal is awful!
This stuff works great for my dry, sensitive skin.  I use everywhere: on my face, body, hands and even feet. It’s been especially good now at repairing my raw, dry hands since I’m having to wash them constantly. 
Also I love that it is FAB is cruelty free and this product is vegan! 

I’m going to dock a star though because in the last tub of this product I received the seal was a huge pain to remove. I tried pulling on the tabs and cut my thumb slightly on the edge in the process. I ended up having to use a knife to remove it and wasted some product in the process.  

This is a great product but please make the seal easier to open!##ENDING##

Added to my loves
Not one to write reviews on products but I really loved this. I have acne prone skin and did not notice any breakouts from this.

Received this as a ten day sample and liked it, but it’s much too heavy for my sensitive skin. It feels great, and is incredibly hydrating, but it stays pretty sticky (as opposed to sinking in and feeling natural), and is probably best on body rather than face.##ENDING##

I love this moisturizer. It’s hydrating and restorative, and I feel like it  really protects my skin. My skin has cleared up dramatically since introducing this moisturizer to my routine.

ACTUALLY SOOTHES SKIN & GETS RID OF REDNESS
I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer. I’m a total beauty addict and there isn’t much I haven’t tried in the way of skincare. This product really stands out! It has an amazing, thick texture, and a lovely scent. 
I use a lot of strong products on my face (containing AHA’s- like Lactic Acid & Glycolic Acid, BHA- Salicylic Acid, forms of Vitamin C- like Ascorbic Acid & THD Ascorbate, Retinoids, etc.), and this cream is the first I have used that actually soothes my skin. Anyone who uses acids on the regular knows it’s something you have to build your skin up to using, and even when your skin is used to it- irritation can occur. I was blown away when I put this cream on my face and it felt so soothing, and took away the redness! 
I can’t recommend this moisturizer enough to anyone who has sensitive skin, has a skin condition like eczema, or is like me and uses strong skincare products. Plus, it’s insanely moisturizing. That being said, it is not one of those moisturizers that you use and it instantly soaks right into the skin. This cream does actually feel like a cream, but I wouldn’t go as far to say that it feels greasy (I have combination skin and I don’t like anything greasy that feels like it clogs pores).
 I will always have a big tub of this stuff around for sure. It really does work wonders on dry skin!##ENDING##

Great for Eczema!
LOVE this product!!! I suffer from eczema on my hands and washing my hands throughout the day causes severe damage (cracked skin, redness, and sensitivity). My eczema has gotten so severe that I have cried from the pain. Thankfully my sister introduced me to this about a year ago and it has changed my life!

I am a Beautiful Cream-Cheesed Bagel
I received this product at my local Sephora store as a free sample with a purchase I made. I hadn't used any FAB products before, and so having read up on what it's supposed to do I used it after a night of pretty intense skincare. My skin was a little mad from all the deep pore cleansing. 

I have sensitive, incredibly dry, volatile skin with eczema. And I mean I don't use ANY powder makeup on my skin (except shadows), and I am only allowed, as per my doctor, to use sensitive skin soaps and Cetaphil lotions.

I put this on my face and was wowed. The texture is whipped,creamy and luxurious and even putting it on my fingers, I was really impressed. My skin calmed /instantly/. It was thick and incredibly hydrating and I could immediately see why it was called an ultra repair cream. It was scent free, which I loved, and made my skin feel soft, dewy and refreshed. I'm blown away that this isn't even considered a 'night' cream, as those tend to be a bit thicker. I'm also blown away that you can use it all over your body!

It's a little expensive for me to be constantly using for any place other than my face, but I WILL be buying the full, value size. I feel like a bagel with the perfect amount of cream cheese.##ENDING##

Product is amazing; seal on tub needs work
I cannot overstate how much I love this cream.  My skin is very dry and very sensitive skin, and I can use this in my face as well as my hands and it does the trick every time.  It doesn’t cause my face to break out and it heals the cracked skin on my hands.  My only criticism is the seal on the tub.  Tubs are fine, but I could not get the seal off!  My nails are also very dry and they were flexing as I tried to pull up the tabs to rip off the safety seal, so I finally had to get pliers, which really backfired because the foil came up but the clear membrane did not, so it ripped in half and I got this precious cream all over my hands - way more than I needed and I didn’t want to put it back in the tub, even though my hands were clean.##ENDING##

Lurv It! Great for Work!
I discovered this because I bought the Fablantis kit I have oily, combination, acne prone skin. I bought this tub for my hands to keep them hydrated at work after I was my hand. I work in a warehouse and wash my hands 5 million times a day because it gets super dirty. This is gentle yet strong enough to moisturize and is not greasy at all.

Pricey, but it’s worth it
I’m an elementary school teacher, so I’m constantly using hand sanitizer and washing my hands throughout the day...my hands get very dry, irritated, and flaky as a result.  I have bottles and tubes of the B&BW lotions all over my classroom, and while they smell nice, they do absolutely nothing to effectively moisturize my skin.  Once I started using this, I could truly notice the difference to my hands.  It’s a little thicker than other products, but quickly absorbs into the skin...definitely gives me noticeable results.  I usually purchase the 8 oz. size which comes in a tube, and recently tried to reorder but noticed that Sephora doesn’t currently offer it...I hope this is just a temporary thing.  Not only is it a much better value on an already pricey item, but I just hate the thought of digging my fingers into the 6 oz. jar...the “germaphobe” in me just thinks that so unhygienic.  Please bring back the 8 oz. tube soon!##ENDING##

My Favorite Skincare Product!
My #1 HOLY GRAIL. This is my absolute favorite moisturizer. Before I got this, Michigan winters were so hard on my skin and I could not find anything that helped my dry flaky patches on my forehead and cheeks. I was so self conscious about it and I couldn't even wear makeup because it looked so bad! I noticed a difference with this moisturizer immediately and love that even though it's thick it sinks into your skin so effortlessly. When I ran out last week I started using a different one until I could restock and within a day my skin was back to its old ways and was soo angry!! If you have struggled to find anything to help with your dry skin, buy this and you won't regret it!##ENDING##

pleasantly surprised!
This is a fantastic product and is a fair price. I recently moved to a drier climate that has very cold and harsh wind. Quickly, my skin was suffering when the winter came around. I ran out my previous moisturizer and came out of the store with this one. I’ve been using it for about a month, day and night. I’ve seen tremendous improvements in the texture of my skin. I am usually acne prone with red scarring (mostly hormonal and stress induced) along with horrible dry patches on my cheeks and nose. My skin is now very smooth and soft because of this moisturizer. It does not clog my pores or cause breakouts and is very soothing. I also use it on my hands and occasionally my legs!##ENDING##

A calming, non-greasy cream
I enjoy this cream in that it goes on smoothly, is not greasy, and seems to sink right into my dry skin.  It has a faint, pleasant scent.  It does not irritate my skin at all.  It's not as thick going on as it looks/feels and spreads nicely, and actually leaves my skin feeling about the same until it has some time to work.  In about 10 minutes my skin feels moisturized.  The reason for 4 stars is that I would in no way consider this to be "intensely hydrating."  It's calming and moisturizing enough, but nothing intense about it.  I also hate that it is in a tub - that's just annoying packaging.##ENDING##

Not just for your face!
I love this cream so much - I actually only found out today that this was intended for your face!
I got a sample several years ago, and have been buying it since, as I found that nothing would do as well as this on my extremely dry hands. In the winter, my skin dries out so badly and the skin on my fingertips cracks open.  I use it on both myself and my kids, and it heals and prevents the wintery itching and cracking.  If you don't want the side effects of steroid creams or hydrocortisone, this is a great option.##ENDING##

Meh..
It’s a nice moisturizer, but it doesn’t help with dry skin at all. Seriously, if you have any dry skin THIS WILL NOT HELP YOU. But if you’re looking to slightly hydrate your skin this will do.

Clogged pores - not for sensitive skin
I started to get whiteheads on my face, so there was something in there that was clogging my pores. I do see now it says for “face and elsewhere” so I don’t think this is good for sensitive skin. I wouldn’t put a body lotion on my face.##ENDING##

Not good for dryness
I was hoping this would cure my dry skin and acne combo. It did not help with dryness at all.

acne prone skin - will never use another product
I have acne prone skin. Very acne prone skin. Most of it is hormonal - but I’ve been struggling with it for years. I also have pretty combination skin, I’m not always very dry but I’m not always oily either. During the winter months, my skin flakes underneath my makeup like crazy. My skin will feel moisturized and I put my makeup on and suddenly my skin is flaming everywhere and looks disgusting. 

This moisturizer changed the game. I won’t use anything else now. I feel so sorry for those who said it makes them break out because I’ve had nothing but a great experience with this moisturizer. I think that’s a true testament to say that everyone reacts differently to things. Even after using a cleanser one day that was too much for my skin, this moisturizer soothed my skin like no other. I can’t believe I didn’t hear about this earlier!!! I always thought using heavy moisturizers was the key to curing dry skin, if you use a little bit, this feels light AND moisturizes your skin like no other. Will never use another product!##ENDING##

I absolutely love this product. I got this as a replacement for my DE F-Balm... Which I started using for eczema (and it works) but it was too expensive to use to much every day.

I love the feel of it, the subtle normal lotion smell, and I am definitely going to get the tube next time.##ENDING##

Buy The Big One
Seriously, buy the big one. You won't regret it. I cannot get enough of this moisturizer. I would buy this by the barrel if I could. I've been using this as a daily moisturizer for years now. I use it on my face and body. For my face I typically just use it at night as it is a heavier moisturizer and use FAB's face specific moisturizer in the morning. But on days I think I really need the extra hydration I'll use it in the morning as well. My skin is incredibly sensitive and this not only moisturizes, sinks in fast, and wears well under makeup...it also calms my skin after iritation! Weather it's a new skin care product that burns, new laundry soap that itches, dry hands from hospital sanitizers, or an allergic reaction, I know this moisturizer will calm and soothe my skin.##ENDING##

WILL CLOG SENSITIVE / ACNE PRONE SKIN!! horrible!!
This product was recommended to me by a good friend, a bit pricy for a face cream compared to my usual fare but nonetheless I decided to try it. It is the worst thing to ever happen to my skin. It clogged every single pore, black heads EVERYWHERE and didn’t moisturize my skin AT ALL. In fact it somehow became more dry. I got so many new pimples I’m literally on the verge of tears. Do NOT buy this product if you have acne prone skin, for the love of god.##ENDING##

Healed 10-year-old skin issues
I started using this on my legs, and within a week and a half, some of the scarring/scaliness on them almost completely healed up.

Love this stuff forever--a perfect winter head-to-toe moisturizer, though I primarily use it on my face at night. I have oily and sensitive skin, so finding a winter face moisturizer, in particular, that is occlusive but not greasy/heavy feeling is tricky. This is the best I've found. The texture is more whipped than just plain thick and heavy, which I love. I know there is eucalyptus leaf oil in it, so it's not completely free of potentially irritating botanical ingredients, but it's pretty far down on the list. I've never experienced any irritation when using this. Highly recommend.##ENDING##

If you have acne, oily, or sensitive skin this product is NOT for you. I only used it for less than a week and it gave to me 2 huge pimples on my forehead and also smaller acne bumps elsewhere.

Smells Terrible and Pills Like Crazy
I bought this stuff with such high hopes, but am thoroughly disappointed. I’m pregnant, so my skin has been extremely dry lately, and I hoped this might helps the dry patches appearing on my face and help soothe my baby bump. But oh my god, the smell is TERRIBLE! It smells like a nasty after shave product. And the lotion was pilling and peeling off of my face almost immediately after application like crazy. I woke up this morning with my skin feeling even more itchy than usual, as well. I like the toner pads and the hydrating serum from FAB, but this stuff has got to go back. The search for a decent face cream continues.##ENDING##

Caused breakout
I do not have acne prone skin, but this made me break out terribly all over in just a week of use on my face.  I would not recommend for a face moisturizer.

A solid no frills moisturizer
This is not the most exciting product ever but it does work well. It’s a very good basic moisturizer. no scent, no special features just moisture. It’s not as intensely moisturizing as it claims and it soaks into my skin very quickly but I have extremely dry skin and usually layer this with a serum or oil so it’s not that big of a deal for me. I like how much product you get for the price. Overall it does what it claims but it’s not the most exciting product so I’m not sure if I’ll repurchase##ENDING##

Goodbye, flakiness!
I typically don't write reviews. But this is the holy grail I've been waiting for and I need to make sure someone else buys this. I have EXTREMELY dry skin. Even during the summers I have flakiness around my face. I've used countless moisturizers but they were either too thick on the skin or it didn't feel like it did anything. I heard great things about this moisturizer so I had to buy.
The first time I put this on my face it actually felt like it did something. The flakiness around my nose has been nearly eradicated and I've only been using this for two days. It's already made such a difference. My face is softer and my face no longer feels tight. The best thing is that a dime size of  this is enough to cover your face. Do yourself a favor and buy this for yourself.##ENDING##

TREAT YOURSELF
TREAT YOURSELF- your skin will thank you! I have unfortunately been blessed with a frustrating mix of very dry, and very oily skin, which is highly sensitive, prone to cystic acne, breakouts, and painful areas of inflammation (thanks dad!) This cream has honestly been a god sent for me, as it has no fillers, parabens, fragrance, or anything that will cause my angry skin to itch or breakout. On the contrary it has helped my skin issues tremendously, and also works well on other areas of the body that can become dry, and sensitive, such as elbows, knees, and feet.

Ive had bumpy KP skin in my arms since I was a teenager. Ive spent 20 years trying to find a product that helped - prescription and over counter. Nothing ever made much of a difference. Until now! This cream is amazing. My arms have not been this clear or smooth in years!! I no longer have to be embarrassed when wearing tank tops, its made that much of a difference. Can’t recommend enough. And even if you don't have KP, this cream is a great moisturizer. It melts into your skin and leaves it soft, mot sticky or oily. Also great for sensitive skin! Its really hard to find creams without perfume/scents. This one has no irritants and it doesn’t smell bad either! Love love love.##ENDING##

Eucalyptus caused burning sensation on face
I was really excited to try this product and with all of the rave reviews, I expected to love it in my dry climate and purchased the largest size. It was nice on my hands but nothing special. When I tried it on my face last night, I immediately felt a light burning sensation. This was odd for 2 reasons: first, this has never happened to me with any moisturizer before and second, this is specifically a “healing” cream. It turns out that the last ingredient, eucalyptus leaf extract, can cause sensitivity in some people and I just happen to be one of them. However, it promotes good oil production so if you have truly dry skin and don’t have a sensitivity to eucalyptus, this could be for you!##ENDING##

Moisture In a Jar
Everyone needs to have at least one traditional moisturizer in their skincare cabinet to go to when they just need some straight up hydration and smoothness. THIS IS IT!!! My skin is combination but leans more towards oily but this cream just blends right in and absorbs immediately. Doesn't feel heavy, gets the job done, and it's great to use either day or night.##ENDING##

New fav moisturizer!
This moisturizer is amazing! I’ve been looking for a go-to, day/night moisturizer for not moths and tried a handful of other products. This is it! Doesn’t make me break out, doesn’t make me feel oily during the day, heals any dry or irritated patches of skin within a day or two! Not to mention my mom is constantly coming into my bathroom to steal some (I bought her a tub as a Christmas gift). I’ve never been this hype over a moisturizer!##ENDING##

I finally found what I was looking for!!
I can't believe it's taken me this long to find this product. I've had dry flaky skin forever and no matter what products or oils I would use my skin would become flaky and crinkly throughout the day or looked cakey with makeup on. At first when I tried this product I thought it was too good to be true because I noticed immediate results, so I decided to wait a couple of weeks before writing a review, but I am seriously in love and I'm never going back to anything else! This lotion keeps my skin hydrated all day/night and isn't too thick or greasy. I also pair this lotion with the Ordinary hyaluronic acid serum before I add the lotion and that helps a ton too!##ENDING##

good for eczema
first aid beauty ultra repair cream helped calm and soothe my atopic dermatitis. my skin felt less itchy and angry after using this. i'm still itchy, but not as much. the only drawbacks were that this was not moisturizing enough for my severely dry atopic dermatitis skin on my face and neck plus it tends to pill. this moisturized my skin without feeling greasy or oily, but i could feel a tackiness or residue on top of my skin -- not exactly a smooth feeling. it worked fine on my hands and body.##ENDING##

Best moisturizer ever for clearing up rosacea
I recently went for my first full makeover at Sephora, and the artist used this moisturizer on my face before applying makeup. I have sensitive skin with rosacea and I had washed my face with water that was too warm right before arriving at Sephora, so my face was super red and blotchy. Once this moisturizer was applied, it almost immediately calmed down my complexion and cleared it up. My sister was with me, and she was amazed at how my face transformed so completely and quickly right before her eyes as she looked at me! Of course I bought this and I've been using it nightly. I even stopped using my prescription rosacea cream because using this on its own does a much better job at keeping my skin soft and even. I've used it on my legs, arms, etc., as well and it's great at moisturizing any area very quickly. I'm a customer of this product for life!##ENDING##

Used during horribly drying Iowa winters with indoor heating & since moving to Texas with summer air conditioning.

total life saver!!
I LOVE this cream. I have really bad eczema and dry skin. I have a steroid cream that seems to be the only thing to relieve itchiness but it doesn’t provide hydration. This does both! I don’t feel dry or itchy at all and I’ve tried everything over the counter. I use this on my legs mostly, but it works in a pinch on my face when I have a dry patch. I’m so glad I found this.

just okay, not as moisturizing as I need.
I bought this in the grapefruit scent because they were out of the original in store—so I’m unsure if the scented formulation is different than the original formula. I have very very dry skin, and this just did not do it for me. I have to apply many layers to feel relatively moisturized (but, my skin is like a desert). I still use it on my neck and chest because I don’t want it to go to waste, and it has some good ingredients in it. I switched to ole henricksen nourish me instead.##ENDING##

I am 47 with fair, red, dry, sensitive skin.  I love this moisturizer so much!!!  I carry the small tube size in my purse for a hand cream.  I always have a big jar in my cupboard for either nighttime moisturizing or winter daily moisturizing.  The texture is lovely!  It reminds me of a thinner noxema without the menthol like feel or smell.  I leave it on my skin for a couple of minutes to absorb before following with a tinted BB/CC cream.  I can’t imagine ever being without this cream!!!##ENDING##

Maybe-
I got this as a sample and it’s the only thing I’m using on a trip in Peru. It smells like alcohol/medicine to me and I’m not a fan of that. I have normal skin but I will say that this has been good for when my face has gotten burned from just being i the higher altitudes. I probably would use this in winter, not summer, and on trips with drier weather. It does what other people say, which is go on smooth and it isn’t oily. That’s refreshing for something that feels more like a heavier cream product.##ENDING##

This product has changed my life. I have incredibly dry, sensitive skin, with extreme redness. This cream has already hydrated my skin and reduced redness after one week of using it.

I actually use this for my eczema because I didn't want to use steroids on my skin and other products seemed too expensive or had too many ingredients. Honestly I was skeptical with this product at first too, because if I'm going to be rubbing the same product on my skin, I want to be sure I know what I'm putting on it. This product is really nice though! I've been using it since last Christmas, and it's been controlling my eczema a lot actually, I won't say buy a value size like I did lol but definitely check it out. I like the smell and it's been soothing and moisturizing from what I can tell.##ENDING##

so underrated!!
I think this brand is critically overlooked because their marketing is so straightforward and people get so caught up in marketing, which is tatcha's whole strategy.  FAB maybe doesn't have the most eye catching branding but their products are so consistently great.  This cream is wonderful, super hydrating, unscented, calming, it does everything it says it does, and the value for money here is unheard of on sephora.  It's a shame that people would seemingly rather pay for packaging and smoke and mirrors, but if you're tired of all that and want a really amazing reasonably priced cream, this is the one.##ENDING##

Perfect for dry sensitive skin
I have been using this product since Spring this year and it does not disappoint. If you have dry and sensitive skin like me, it’s the perfect moisturiser! The only reason I give it four stars instead of a full five star rating is because it is quite heavy on the skin but if you get it during winter and not when it’s humid it’s the perfect moisturiser.

This is a pretty good moisturizing cream. I have some areas on my skin that are super dry sometimes, and this works pretty well. Lately I've been using this to moisturize my face after cleansing, and it's not heavy at all. I'm able to apply makeup after I've moisturized my face with this repair cream. My only complaint is that while it moisturizes, I feel like it doesn't necessarily "repair" my skin. I've tried a different cream that does this, so I probably wouldn't purchase this one again. I have redness, dry patches, irritation, etc. on my face, which I've been dealing with the past couple years. My skin was fine and then I suddenly started having these issues. I suppose it's part of old age. I do recommend this cream but for me, it works better on my body than on my face.##ENDING##

Amazed at the results!
Backstory - (Skip ahead to "Results" if you don't care about my story) I have dry, sensitive skin that can become greasy with heavy/oily products. I rarely get acne and when I do it's in conjunction to my "monthly visitor). In July I stopped taking a medication (unrelated to skincare/acne). Within a couple weeks my face exploded. Not only acne but just redness. My routine is below.

high hopes
Wanted to love this, and had a good experience at first when I started doing any skincare routine at all. A few upsides are that it's fragrance free, does indeed relieve itching, and makes your tattoos pop nicely. Unfortunately, after a while I noticed that it isn't hydrating, even when used on wet skin (although that helps) and it tends to make my face puffy after I use it at night. It feels a little greasy and sits on top of my skin without absorbing much or at all. I get better results using CeraVe's moisturizing cream tbh. Would use maybe if you have bouts of itchiness and already have a better moisturizer on.##ENDING##

Burns my skin??
I have very sensitive combination skin, so I've had trouble finding a moisturizer that works for me. I went into Sephora and asked an employee for a gentle, hydrating, noncomedogenic moisturizer. She recommended this and said it's the best one for problem skin. But when I put it on after washing my face that night it BURNED. I kept trying to use it and give it another chance, but every time I put it on it burned my skin. Not sure why it didn't work for me since other people seem to love it, but maybe try a sample of it first if you have sensitive skin like me.##ENDING##

Quick absorption, minimal smell dissipates quickly, and no lasting residue.I have been religiously using this on my hands for 2 years and will never get another product. Love it!##ENDING##

Amazing for eczema and dry skin!!
This stuff is truly amazing. I was hesitant in buying it because I have tried SO many creams for my facial eczema and it was kind of expensive. If you have super dry skin like me, BUY THIS! I put it on every day and night and it keeps my skin hydrated all day/night long. It is so nice under makeup too and the perfect consistency. I know this is going to be a LIFESAVER when my eczema flares up in the winter. I have other moisturizers that help for a short period, but I will still get flaky dry spots by the end of the day. This is the only moisturizer I have found that truly keeps my skin looking glowy and hydrated all day long!!! No more constant trips to the bathroom to reapply lotion. Thank you first aid beauty!##ENDING##

Amazing!
I bought this because this summer was so hot, my eczema was flaring much more than usual. Full disclosure - I have pretty mild eczema, so this review may not apply if yours is worse. Just on my face and neck, and usually in super small spots (like just my eyelids, for example) but it's difficult to treat because most of the creams aren't supposed to go on your eyelids. Somehow the prescription cream I used to use has changed and the new formula burns almost as bad as the eczema does, which makes the whole thing kind of pointless. The reviews say this works for eczema so I thought I would try it - and IT WORKS. I use it everywhere and for everything. On my eyelids when my eczema breaks out (usually stops itching/burning within a day and redness gone within a week - about the same as the prescription worked honestly), on sunburn (I never peel anymore), on my hands, on cracked heels - I'm convinced there's no skin problem this stuff can't solve!!##ENDING##

If you're looking to keep your face hydrated
I've been using this mainly as a moisturizer for my face for at least 10 years now. It's definitely a holy grail product for me (I have combo, but mainly dry skin). A little does go a long way and I probably replace it every 5-6 months (keep in mind, I also share it with my husband who is also a believer).##ENDING##

This is the only moisturizer I've found that works for my extremely sensitive, temperamental, combination skin. I use it year round, on my face and neck, and it helps keep my skin soft no matter the season. It has no scent, feels luxurious, applies smoothly, and doesn't make me feel/look greasy.##ENDING##

Not for me
The first thing that puts me off is the weird sunscreen scent. The second being the sticky feeling on your skin after applying the cream, and it stays the same for 30 mins, so, not sure if it really is fast-absorbing as advertised. Would not recommend using on face, it feels heavy. 
I'll give it credit for soothing parched, sunburnt skin pretty well, being safe for sensitive skin, and for its generous amount compared to the price .##ENDING##

LIFE SAVER!
I’ve always loved this but today I came to realize I have taken it for granted because this is incredible, amazing stuff!  I tend to not think of it until the change of seasons or winter when my skin is raw and flaky and in desperate need of help.  This is soothing and it makes skin look much better after a few days of use.  It also works awesome as a protectant in cold windy weather.  Today, however, I have been suffering from some odd and excruciating allergic reaction on my neck and upper chest.  It itches and burned so much that I could think of nothing else and became progressively worse as I couldn’t resist touching and scratching.  I tried hydrocortisone, calamine and topical Benadryl but nothing made a bit of difference.  On a whim, I decided to try FAB Ultra Repair cream and figured it would at least moisturize the area.  The relief was instant upon application!   I put it on 8 hours ago and still no itching or burning. I don’t think I have ever actually purchased it because I always snag it as a Sephora reward when it’s available.  I won’t risk being without this again, I’m getting the big size!  Side note: I have oily, acne prone skin and this has never clogged my pores or felt greasy.  Love!!##ENDING##

best moisturizer ever
I love this product. I’m on prescription acne medication so my skin can get very dry and this completely gets rid of the dryness. My makeup applies so much better and my skin looks so great. It does have eucalyptus so it isn’t entirely fragrance free but It isn’t a very heavy scent and does fade away quickly on the skin.##ENDING##

Sits on your skin
The moisturizer is VERY heavy. I didn’t find it to be penetrating to the skin at all. It sits on the skin and leaves a white residue that you have wipe off with a towel. When you do rub it in, it’s very greasy and leaves you shiny even if you don’t even have makeup on. I haven’t seen any improvements in my skin since using it for months now.##ENDING##

Dry Winter Skin Solace
I live in Buffalo, NY and my skin gets horrendously dry during the winter time. This is the only solace I gave found that helps! My only complaint is that it can feel a little heavy or greasy (on it's own) at first, but it does absorb. I also add a few drops of face oil into to help with my dryness and haven't had any bad reactions to it. I have sensitive, combo skin but this really comes in handy during the winter!##ENDING##

Speedy Relief for Irritable Itchy Skin!!!
I cannot do without this! If, like me, you've got easily irritable skin, very reactive to dust, pollen, pollution, give this a shot. It seems to work better when I use it on clean skin defensively, before any irritation occurs (before leaving the house exposed to the elements). On active rashes, it takes effect within 2 minutes on me. I boost it with the Cannabis and Oat Dry Oil for extra moisture where and when I need it. I love that in addition to colloidial oatmeal, it includes chrysanthemum, licorice, and white tea!.##ENDING##

Holy Grail
This is my go to lotion for the winter time or whenever my hands/feet are starting to feel dry. All it takes me is one application and the next day it will already be so much smoother and hydrated. I rarely use it on my face but will when I have an excessive dry patch which it takes care of easily. Has a bit of a smell but I don’t think it’s a fragrance... it’s hard to describe. I always have this on hand and keep it in my nightstand at all times as well as having a travel size in my purse. It’s pricy but worth it for how well it works.##ENDING##

Best Moisturizer Ever
I started using this moisturizer in 2015 and haven't used anything else since. I have very dry skin and this makes my face feels so moisturized throughout the day (like I just reapplied)! The 8oz tube lasts me about 8 months (I use it only on my face and neck, twice a day). I love that it's cruelty-free and vegan as well. It's just the best. If I could only buy one beauty product for the rest of my life, it would be this.##ENDING##

I have to say this cream is sooo gooood. It sooth my sensative skin in just one use. I have very sensative skin. I used Estee lauder night cream, that one caused unseen bumps in my jaw line.

Burned when applied
It burned a little when applied and made my face a little red, which is disappointing because it specifically says it is for sensitive skin. Must have been a small reaction to some of the ingredients. It helped get the texture of my skin back to normal when my face needed some intense hydration, but it also broke out my forehead. So sort of a win some/lose some product. Would not buy again.##ENDING##

BEST MOISTURIZER
I don’t know why it takes such a long time for me to get my hands in this moisturizer, I saw this years back but never get interested since all of their products look similar to me. This is the best moisturizer, just work how it should be! No offensive fragrance, gentle, affordable yet effective.

I put this as a face cream, but this also works for dry area all over my body. Highly recommended!##ENDING##

Huge Disappointment
While using this moisturizer I kept wondering why my skin felt dry but didn’t look dry after application... Then I realized that this garbage didn’t absorb into the skin. At all!!! It would just sit on top of my skin balling up and peeling off with a slight touch. It would simply mask any dry spots but not actually moisturize them. Unbelievable. Worse than this garbage is only Olay Regenerist that used to ball up DURING application. Thumbs down...##ENDING##

Miracle Cream
My skin became very irritated after moving to a city with extreme sun and heat. It was peeling daily, very rough, and dry. Tried everything and nothing seemed to help. I was pretty upset as I went from having smooth porcelain skin to what felt like sandpaper of a skin. 

Gave this a try and wow...after one use and all the problems went away. Not sure what is in this miracle concoction but it completely soothed my skin. I use it daily now at night on top of my serums and it’s kept the problems away.

Miracle Worker
I accidentally overused acids (glycolic toner, to be exact) and the stinging, burning, and peeling started. By the end of the day, I would have these massive dry, scaly spots. It was embarrassing! Then I remembered that I had picked this up on a whim last Black Friday. It was a miracle worker for my elbows last winter... Could it work on my face, too?! I put on two layers and went to bed, adding a little extra on the really dry, scaly parts. While it didn't solve the issue overnight, I could tell when I put my makeup on the next morning that it was helping. I'm taking a break from acids and continuing to use this, and I'm excited to see how much it's already healing my face. 

As an added bonus, m skin is pretty sensitive and it didn't make me break out.##ENDING##

My Everyday Hand Cream
I use this daily. I really like the clean, natural soapy scent. I can therefore use this any time even when I don't feel like lathering on fragrance. The whipped creamy texture feels nice on my hands. I also like that this can be used when my hands feel red/irritated and with sensitive skin, this is an occasional thing I encounter. My only complaints are it does take frequent reapplication and it can be slightly oily feeling on my hands. For now its my go-to hand cream. I keep it on the bathroom counter and the travel size in my purse.##ENDING##

Safe for Sensitive Skin
I love this cleanser so much. I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this cleaner removes my makeup and any oils or dirt from my face without stripping moisture or making my face feel tight. I will say just from user error that a little goes a long way because it foams the more you massage it with water and using a nickel sized amount with create so much foam as well as make your skin feel tight. It also will burn your eyes lol so close your eyes because for some reason I didn’t. Overall this product calms my skin and I’m on my second one and I’m almost out.##ENDING##

Very Hydrating!
I was shopping by myself, at my local Sephora in the mall. I only had $40.00 so I bought this along with a face mask and an eye mask. When I first used it, I was surprised because of how moisturizing it was (at the time I didn't religiously drink water). It smells good and it calmed my skin down. The only problem I have is it almost seems to make sweat condense on your T-Zone which was odd because I have normal skin and I'm never oily. But, I just rubbed it in a little bit more and it looked normal. Overall, an amazing product! You need this!##ENDING##

great for dry skin/eczema patches
I really love this cream and it actually works for extremely dry skin. I had really dry patches possibly eczema on my face. I’ve tried several high end creams and oils to no avail, but this cream cured them within 2-3 days. Only reason for 4 stars, when I had irritated thin and easily broken skin from using topical Retinols, this cream would have been perfect if it wasn’t for the severe stinging I felt from one of the ingredients (I think eucalyptus? ) this ingredient should be removed bc it is not suitable for compromised skin. Bc of this, I would only use this if my skin is dry but not in an irritated state.##ENDING##

I really wanted to like this but unfortunately, it stung very badly to apply. I tried it out for my face and each time, my skin just burned and became very uncomfortable. I began to question if it belongs on my face but yes, it can be used there. I would stick to only body with this one. I love the texture but it didn’t mix well with my sensitive skin. I will continue to use it up on my hands##ENDING##

I was having a serious emergency,  the recipe for the Vitamin E moisturizer had changed and my face was peeling and feeling HORRIBLE.

Great Evening Moisturizer!
This doesn't break me out but deeply hydrates! I love using this at night however I would not use in the morning because it is a little thick and does take time to soak into the skin and I don't have all that time in the morning before I apply my makeup. I keep repurchasing this moisturizer!##ENDING##

Super hydrating and doesn't break me out
This moisturizer is a saving grace for when my skin gets super dry. I normally have combination acne prone skin and I will sometimes get annoying dry patches. This product is my go to when it seems like my face needs extra hydration. I apply it at night since it is pretty thick, but my skin feels instantly moisturized once applied. I also love that it does break me out for how rich the formula is. This is definitely a holy grail product for me!##ENDING##

Works Wonders!
This cream is more than I could've asked for! I was just looking for a new face cream and I liked the ingredients, price tag, and that it was cruelty free. Before I could use it as a face cream, I broke out in a very bad rash on my ankle. My skin was rough, itchy, and irritated but I couldn't use any anti-itch treatment because that was what caused it in the first place. Then I picked up my bottle of FAB Ultra Repair Cream to read the label and low and behold, it seemed it might help. So I lathered it on and my rash was finally starting to heal! Thus, I brought it with me on my trip to Alaska where I got sunburned and my skin was getting dry from the cold and wind. With this cream, not only did my skin quickly repair itself, but I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't break out! I usually break out when I go somewhere with a different climate and camp but I had no issues at all. I'm still using it and I have broken out a bit, but that is probably due to the amount of junk food I'm eating. It's still much less than I would expect, which is wonderful.##ENDING##

Best moisturizer EVER!
I LOVE this moisturizer! I have never found a moisturizer that works so well for my skin type. 
Not only is it great on my face, but for my entire body! It's helped my breakouts in my T zone and gave me great hydration in my checks which tend to be dry. 
My boyfriend also started using it and now he moisturizes every day (rather than one a year). It even cleared up some problematic spots for him too! 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!##ENDING##

Simple
This has become my favorite moisturizer so far! The ingredients are simple, it's light-weight, and a little goes a long way. Def my favorite skincare purchase this summer.

Not for acne prone skin
I really wanted to like it and used it for long time but I couldn’t do it. On the first day, I used it at night. My nose had some little pimples which I never had before. Because it had a lot of good reviews, I kept using it couple more times. 5 days after that, my skin broke out like crazy, a lot pimples on my cheeks, chin and even forehead. It was really irritated and itchy sometimes. Very greasy. I felt like I was wearing wax on my face. It was uncomfortable. I had to return it.##ENDING##

Broke me OUT ??
Let me start by saying that to start my skin is no where near great. I have hormonal acne and sensitive skin. She’s sensitive okay ? A few people recommended this to me so i decided to try it out bc i was looking for a new moisturizer- something that wasn’t cetaphil bc i wanted something “fun”. I used it for maybe 4 days and i broke out over my ENTIRE face - not just my chin and jaw like i normally do. I had breakouts all over my nose and forehead and cheeks which never happens. My skin was red and inflamed and looked like absolute garbage for two weeks after i stopped using it. Once i stopped everything eventually cleared up back to my skin’s normal hormonal broken out state. It had way too strong of a scent for my sensitive baby skin 
I returned##ENDING##

Skin: hormonal acne, sensitive skin
Odor: too strong of a scent

I'm giving this four stars even though 90% of the time, I can't use this product. Consistent use of any product with shea butter will break me out, and this one is no different - but I still keep a mini tube on hand to use for 2-3 days after a lactic acid peel as this cream is fantastic for peel aftercare with its simple and effective formula that includes soothing ingredients like oatmeal. As long as I limit it to one or two days post-peel, this is great and helps my skin recover and renew.##ENDING##

the best!
This is one of my go-to products!! I have repurchased this many times now. I have combination skin that gets dry in the winter and oily in the summer, but this moisturizer works for me all year round! Sometimes in the summer I'll use a more lightweight moisturizer during the day, but I can still use this as well. The "intense hydration" part can make you think that it's a thick or heavy cream, but it's actually not! And somehow it still gives you all the hydration you need and never gets oily or anything. My husband who has super dry, sensitive skin and eczema loves to use this as well! This is a must-have for us.##ENDING##

Cleared Away Years of Eczema
I've had eczema on the back of my arms for years.  Then after having my baby I ended up with eczema on the sides of my thighs. At first I used this as my daytime lotion, under my make-up and it felt light, silky, and smelled nice.  Then I randomly thought to put it on my arms and within a day I noticed the bumps start to fall off.  Within a week the color of my skin is no longer full of red little spots. I'm now using this all over my arms and legs and am having the best results. I'm so happy with the results of this product.##ENDING##

MIRACLE CREAM
I bought this because I was looking for something to get for my boyfriend since he has eczema and really dry skin. I ended up using it one morning when I was in a rush and OH MY GOODNESS it has CHANGED my skincare. 

First of all, I have been using coconut oil on my face for about five years and it has completely changed my skin in general. And by “changed” I mean I went from having acne all over my cheeks and combination skin to now my skin is completely clear, and I get complemented on it all the time because of how it always has a natural glow. 

So that helped, but this has saved it in a completely different way. I am very fair skinned and my skin is supersensitive. I burn easily, and a lot of products make my skin really red. 

This product is phenomenal for helping any issue it may have. Sunburn? I put this on and within a day or two my skin is mostly back to normal (which is a miracle for me who is from Siberia). Need something easy to put under make up? This works perfectly, and actually I have noticed my make up stays on longer. Boyfriend has eczema and super dry skin? He absolutely loves this stuff and it has been a lifesaver for him as well. I even recently got a blister on my toe that hurt really really badly. I put this on and it helped heal the skin like Neosporin... except better.

I now use it every day and I take it with me everywhere. I will even occasionally put it on my lips if they are feeling extra dry or extra burnt. 

It doesn’t make your skin look super dewy or anything but for an every day moisturizer that you can use for literally anything it’s absolutely phenomenal. It also plays really well with other products in my experience. 

Do yourself a favor and at least buy the 2oz version. It’s only $12 and it really is worth every penny. I would continue to buy this if it was $60 (though I  really happy it’s not).##ENDING##

I have combination skin oily in some spots dry in others. & LET ME TELL YOUUUUU THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!! I struggled to find a moisturizer that would do the job but not make me oily until I came across this. I go tanning about 3 times a week and it started to cause my face to break out due to dryness and my skin trying to make up for moisture by over sebum production. I noticed a drastic change after just one use.  personally only use this at nighttime before going to bed so it will absorb fully. You won’t be disappointed with this one!##ENDING##

Best I've found for sensitive skin
I have VERY dry skin & sensitivity due to rosacea & have been using this for years. When my skin is itchy & irritated this is my go to. The one thing I don't like about it is that no matter what I do it tends to pill up even if my skin is exfoliated, no other products have been used or whatever else may cause this to happen. I've found using a facial spray first & then applying while skin is still wet helps a lot. Just hate that I have to use an extra product for this reason. Dont think I could live without though. It's saved my face many times! The amount of product you get for the price. compared to everything else out there is fantastic too.##ENDING##

AMAZING FOR DRY, COMBO, & SENSITIVE SKIN
Honestly I am in loveeeeeeee with this product for my skin because I have combination that leans definitely more dry, so it’s perfect for me! The reason I am leaving 4 stars is because it is definitely not for oily skin!!!!!!! Please do not buy if you have oily skin it will intensify it! If you have more combo to dry this is definitely for you. It’s incredible. I also have highly sensitive skin and this does not affect that at all! GO TO SEPHORA AND GET A SAMPLE!!!!!!!! I fell in love with it after I got a sample. I live an hour from a Sephora and drove back for this!##ENDING##

I bought this during a sale of the economy sz lotion. It was like 12oz for like $20 or something ridic cheap like that. I used this up.. first on my face, then used over half of it as a body lotion. I used it for way too long. I’ve noticed more hydrating/ glowing results with origins/fresh beauty. I wish I would’ve just splurged on something I really wanted vs this bland stuff. if u want something cheap go for it though...##ENDING##

All time best moisturizer
I have dry skin and this is my favorite moisturizer I’ve found! Other ones that I’ve tried leave my skin still feeling dull and dry but this one keeps me hydrated all day. I use it after I wash my face and before I prime for foundation. The jar lasts me so long and I will keep repurchasing!!##ENDING##

I wanted to like this moisturizer especially after hearing about it from people that I know. But I just didn't like it. I didn't find it moisturizing compared to other moisturizers that I have used. And I haven't noticed my skin improving at all after more than 6 months of using it. I just kept using it because the 6 oz is a lot. There's still a little bit left but I think I'm going to just throw it away.##ENDING##

This makes my hand feel super smooth and soft. I also use a small amount this on my arms and my legs and I absolutely love it! It's not oily at all. I have not tried it on my face yet since my face is prone to breakouts from lotions but I somehow feel like it would be OK. It's a bit pricey for cream but I've switched over from the L'Occitaine body cream and love this one better.##ENDING##

Where have I seen you before?
Good stuff but it’s essentially a nice version of a cream typically found in the drugstores—-do they still make it? I’m not going to use a brand name but it was commonly used for sunburn relief.

HOLY GRAIL FOR DRY\SENSITIVE SKIN
I purchased this product because I was looking for a good everyday moisturizer for my face. I have very dry sensitive skin that is eczema prone on my face and neck, so I was looking for a fragrance-free and allergy tested product when I decided to try this out. I’m so glad I did because this product really changed my skin, I apply it morning and night to my face and my skin is so hydrated. Would recommend this to anyone with eczema or another skin condition. I don’t think I’ll ever stop buying this!!!##ENDING##

Not worth the hype
I was ecstatic to try out this product as this way almost twice the product for half of the price in comparison to Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream. I've been using this product for five months and have noticed no noticeable improvement in the hydration of my skin. This cream is also terrible under my light makeup routine (only tinted moisturizer and concealer) and even flakes off. I thought that was possibly due to the fact that I needed to exfoliate but even after making exfoliation a priority this cream still works terribly with makeup application.  As I am not a person who struggles with acne, I have noticed an increase in sporadic pimples within my five months usage.  I only gave this product two stars because I feel like it is a decent moisturizer for the rest of my body as it does not leave me feeling oily. It's really unfortunate this did not work out for me as a face cream. I would definitely not recommend this product.##ENDING##

The best!!! I use this everywhere for everything! It helps keep my sensitive skin moisturized without any reactions. It's great used as a body or hand lotion--nongreasy, aborbs quickly. I slather it all over my face when I'm using retinol, when it's super dry (airplane, outside, inside, EVERYWHERE). I have several different sizes stashed all over the house and in every purse because you never know when you need some.##ENDING##

Avenges Dry Skin
I have been using this moisturizer for years and my face is absolutely grateful. I was recommended this product by a Sephora beauty advisor because I have eczema and this cream is great for those with skin conditions, dry skin, and sensitive skin! This cream is so rich and creamy that a little goes a long way. When you put it on, your face feels hydrated and soft. I use this on other places on my body and not just my face which is what makes this product so great— it’s versatile. The amount of product you get for the price is amazing! A tube or jar can last me a really really long time. I have tried other moisturizers but I always come back to First Aid Beauty. It’s just that good.##ENDING##

It really does repair skin
This cream is good but no great. It does moisturize my skin and leaves it hydrated without being sticky. Is you have sensitive or dry skin, it will feel heavenly. It has also helped me reduce my redness and some dry patches around my mouth. The problem I have with this is that when I use a little too much, it looks as if some of it didn't get absorbed and piles up on top of the skin, but I still recommend it.##ENDING##

All around awesome lotion
I am so glad i grabbed this as a point bonus! I just started working in retail- and something is irritating my hands, arms, and neck! I was blotchy and bumpy with an itch that was unbearable! On a whim i grabbed this sample to keep in my pocket and OMG it took away the itch almost instantly, calmed the redness and is healing the little bumps on my hands.  Best of all it seems to have just enough of a barrier that it is keeping me from getting irritated and looking healthy again!  Our weather is all over the place too- cold in the morning, dripping sweat by afternoon and this lotion handles it all without any weirdness.  I am not sure if i would use it on my face under makeup, but have used a small amount before bed with great results, and even my husband who HATES the feel of lotions let me put some on his flaky skin under his beard and it took his itchy flakeyness away overnight!  Definitely going to keep this on hand at all times, since my youngest sometimes suffers from eczema/dermatitis in the fall, i have a hunch it’s going to be awesome for that too!##ENDING##

I like this product. It moisturizes my skin well and looks very natural. I have very sensitive skin so I thought this would be a good choice because it says “safe for sensitive skin”.

Great for any skin type
I love this moisturizer so much that I have a jar in my bathroom, a large tube on my vanity, and a travel one in my purse. I have oily, acne-prone skin. I've used all sorts of face lotions that claim to help control oil, fight acne, or is soothing for sensitive skin. None of them have been repurchased. I love that the First Aid Moisturizer has no scent and that it makes my skin soft and hydrated with absolutely no irritation. I've even gotten my husband hooked on this. He has normal skin. We both use it for our face and sometimes hands if they're a bit dry. I am definitely a loyal customer and I hope they don't change up this magical formula.##ENDING##

Game changer for dry skin
This moisturizer is amazing for dry skin. A little bit goes a really long way, and it sinks into the skin beautifully. My skin feels so hydrated and actually looks more glowy since I started using it. It has kind of a medicinal smell, but it goes away really fast. I feel like this product just really nourishes my skin and repairs the dry, flakey areas. I also find that it sits really well underneath makeup. The price seemed a bit much at first (I’m used to drugstore moisturizers) but I think this is absolutely worth it. I’ve been telling my friends and family about it like crazy.##ENDING##

Hear Ye, Hear Ye
Gather around peeps—it’s story time. I have had acne since forever—and by forever I mean since I was 12...almost 13 years later and here we are. My acne prone skin is not friendly acne—it’s intense and painful and here to stay. My acne comes with a warning that says intruder alert. However, recently my skin was looking meh as per usual and I decided you try this product (which I’ve had forever but never used) despite how hydrating it is. I use it under my acne medication both morning and night—and this changed the game. I mean my skin feels and looks fabulous. I can’t even begin to praise this enough. Get it. Please.

Best moisturizer ever!
I've been using this moisturizer for 3 years now, and it's the best thing I've ever tried for my very dry, sensitive 24 y/o skin - you can slather it on thickly if you're feeling really dry and tight, and it still absorbs super quickly. It doesn't feel sticky or claustrophobic (which is one of my big problems) at all! I use it right after showering, and my skin is smooth, soft, and clear. Love it, will use it forever!##ENDING##

Comedogenic-broke me out
I got a big sample size with my rewards points and took it on a trip to use it instead of my usual moisturizer. The smell and feel is very similar to "Hope in a jar" although this cream is a bit thicker. A few days after I started using it I got horrible, painful breakouts along my chin. I have combination skin but I have not had a breakout in years since I started using Retin-A. Now I have to deal with the hyper pigmentation from the horrible pimples. Not for me.##ENDING##

It's basic but that's how I like it
I bought this because I was looking for something more hydrating than a serum and not as heavy as an oil. I've been using it for over 2 years now and this cream is great on its own or layered over other products. I have normal skin and like to try out new products, so my skin tends to freak out from certain ingredients, the environment, and too much layering.  Just cleansing and using this cream alone has helped keep my face together from full out allergic reactions. It's a bit heavy for humid summers and not always hydrating enough for East Coast winters, but it's been a lifesaver for healing my face after being out in the sun, allergic reactions, literally everything. I've mixed it with vitamin C and retinol serums that I was easing into and it works great. This cream isn't super special, but the 6 oz lasts forever and is a great basic to have when your skin is exhausted from your multi-step skincare routine.##ENDING##

MY BESTIE
This moisturizer has a thick consistency. It is almost similar to CeraVe, but a tad bit thicker, which I actually don’t mind especially when it’s really doing its job-to moisturize my skin. I use this mostly at night because I know I will wake up to a hydrated skin the next day. I use it for my hands too! I am glad I have found this product! It has a hint of minty fragrance but not overpowering. No more dry flakey skin and my bestie in Winter time! It is just the best!##ENDING##

BEST MOISTURIZER EVER!!!!
I have VERY dry skin, and having eczema makes it even worse. I tried this moisturizer about a year ago and it’s the best thing for my skin. when I don’t use it for a day or two, I notice a difference. it is a heavy cream (which you need if you have very dry skin) and it can clog your pores, but it doesn’t bother me. it is also good to use on your whole body if you’re dry or have eczema##ENDING##

Not for allergy prone/ sensitive skin
I wanted to like this product and I used it for waaaay too long. After a month of using all First Aid Beauty products, I have to throw it all in the trash. I have tiny bumps and white heads all over my cheeks. It did moisturize my face but it irritated it terribly. If you have sensitive skin, be cautious and patch test 1st. My face is an itchy disaster##ENDING##

Good; Not as hydrating as anticipated...
This stuff is great! It’s very lightweight and absorbs within seconds, which makes it great under makeup. I live in a very dry climate, and although my skin is normal, I get a little bit drier in the wintertime. I haven’t noticed my skin being exceptionally dry, but I do wish that this cream gave my face just a bit more moisture than it does. It’s not the cream’s fault though. For me and my skin type this would be more of a summertime moisturizer because it’s hydrating without leaving a residue behind. I can see someone who lives in a more humid climate really enjoying this. I really like this cream, but don’t know if I would repurchase. (I’m trying to restock my makeup/skincare with clean, non-toxic products.)##ENDING##

AMAZING
This cream is incredible!!! I have never been so excited about a skincare product. This winter I experienced  driest and flakiest skin ever. Not only that, but I was breaking out with cysts for the first time since high school. I was getting insecure and frustrated, especially since I have multiple topical prescriptions from my dermatologist that were doing nothing. I never had this problem during previous winters, so I didn't know what to do.

After much research, I stumbled upon this product and decided to give it a try based on the reviews. I was nervous at first to put it on my face because my skin is so sensitive but WOW. This saved my skin for real! My face is so red and irritated after the shower especially, and this instantly evens out my skin tone. I lather this on now lol. This product is extremely hydrating and even cleared all my breakouts which I'm assuming were from dryness. I only use this at night just because it can get oily if I use it in the morning before makeup, but once a day does the trick.

I  now recommend this product to anyone I can. I top it off with jojoba oil every night before bed and my skin is smooth and glowing in the morning. I will never stop using this product!!!##ENDING##

HG Fall/Winter Moisturizer
This is my HG fall/winter moisturizer. I find that I need to take a few extra minutes working it in and letting it sink in completely, but it leaves my skin soft, doesn’t feel heavy, and doesn’t clog my pores. Once I started religiously using this moisturizer, I found that I didn’t need as much foundation. I haven’t tried it in the spring/summer yet, but I’m thinking I’ll need to switch to something a little lighter.##ENDING##

Great product, great price
My HG moisturizer. Fantastic for dry skin. Simple, effective and the best bang for your buck ever. You cannot beat the price point. It is unscented but it still obviously smells like something. I am not crazy about the smell but you only smell for like the 3 seconds when you are putting it on. You can layer it on or do a light application. I have dry skin and it’s great.##ENDING##

I have used this product for a very long time and it’s really beautifully moisturizing. I have one complaint - the eucalyptus oil. Throughout my time using this product - sometimes I would get a burning sensation after applying and I never knew why. My dermatologist told me that it is 100% the oil, since I’m sensitive to all essential oils. I would really love to see this product without the oil - as I’m sure everyone else would. It adds no fragrance so I really don’t see why it is necessary. And if it is “necessary” for a certain concern - I would love a version without it. I praise the simplicity and nourishing benefits of this moisturizer but I’ve been contemplating changing it due to the essential oil. So yeah. If you agree - write a review saying so - so the company can hear and listen to our concerns :)##ENDING##

Ingredients: eucalyptus oil

great for eczema
I purchased this product because I was looking for a good winter moisturizer that would also address the redness and flaking skin from eczema. I wanted to find an alternative to topical steroids which I had to apply multiple times per day to see any improvement. Since I started using this moisturizer 5 days ago my eczema patches have all but cleared up. My skin is more moisturized and my skin tone appears more even and less red. I'm very glad that I bought the largest bottle available!##ENDING##

I used this moisturizer for a few years actually. I used to love it in the winter months and would always order it for the winter. However, this year I broke out very bad all over my chin and got closed comedones over my chin. I read that heavy creams could cause this so I stopped using this and replaced with Clinique face lotion and my breakouts cleared up within a few days and I hadn't put anything else new into my skin care routine so I am confident saying it was this. I didn't believe a cream could make me break out but I was wrong. I used to love this lotion but I guess it does not work for me anymore. It's a great face moisturizer and really clears up dry skin but just be careful as it's quite heavy and could clog up your pores. I would recommend this product but with caution.##ENDING##

My hands get super super super dry during winter, I decided to give it a try because it has quite good reviews. Have been using it for three months, it’s just okie for me, I usually apply 1.5cm amount to my hands after washing, it doesn’t keep my hands moisturised for more than 1-2 hours, it doesn’t really do ultra repair for my hands.##ENDING##

This is now a must have for me. I purchased it as part of a set around Christmas and have been using it ever since. The cold weather had my skin really dry and flaky. I started using this on my face, arms, hands, and anywhere else that felt dry or itchy on any given day. My skin has been so much better. It's been a few months and I still have half a tub. This can feel a little oily-ish when you first put it on your face but it absorbs quickly. Not sure if it would be as effective for someone with oily skin.##ENDING##

Just Okay
I’ve been using this for a month and I haven’t been too impressed. It’s nice on my skin other than my face that isn’t especially dry, but it hasn’t done anything for my dry winter skin on my face. When I apply it to my face, I still have dry spots and peeling in a few places. I do like that it isn’t oily or greasy, and it’s a good amount of product for the price. But it would probably be best for someone who’s skin isn’t extra dry.##ENDING##

Ordered a set they had during holidays :  cream, oatmeal mask, pads, serum, face wash - G R E A T   stuff!!!  This cream is so  soothing and moisturizing,  reduces redness, such a difference in how my skin looks and feels!! Absolurely love it , already purchased another jar! love the mask too - buying another one next week!

there’s no skin pampering with this moisturizer. place, hold and touch your face in 3 minutes and your face develops eraser peel rolls all over. maybe its my skin, but be warned that all this reviews seem dubious. skin early 30s, combo skin. would not recommend. many reviews with same complaint.##ENDING##

I have really dry skin but have never really put much effort into it. However, I noticed a patch developing where my skin looked flaky, so I decided to try a moisturizer. This was recommended to me, so I picked it up, and I am quite pleased with this purchase. For one, the amount of product you get is insane, so even though I was a bit put off by the price, I definitely think it was worth it. I've only been using this for a day and a half and I can already see some minor improvements.##ENDING##

Moisturizes but breaks me out
Definitely not an everyday moisturizer for me. It did help when my skin was super dry from the crazy winter weather we have been having in the east coast. But once my skin was hydrated, it broke me out. It also gave me little bumps. Even though it says for sensitive skin, always try a little patch before putting it all over your face. So I just started using it for the rest for my hands and elbows.##ENDING##

Eczema GONE!!
This is my first ever review on Sephora because I feel like more people need to know living with eczema can be this easy.
I had an ugly raised dry patch on my stomach from an old break out that still itches. I have try putting on Papaya ointment, honey-based “eczema treating miracle”, etc. But nothing has worked.
Last week I got bored and tried putting a dab of this cream on my stomach, I woke up with soft, flat, less itchy skin just over night!!! Now the spot has been completely soften. I think I might even be gone within this week.

If you have eczema, please give this a try!##ENDING##

A great moisturizer. I can wear this day or night and always know that I am getting the perfect amount of moisture. This moisturizer makes my skin so soft and never ever greasy. It takes about a minute to fully absorb into the skin and I can wear it under makeup with no worries of pilling or greasiness. I am acne prone with easily clogged pores- whenever my skin is acting up, I turn to this moisturizer to repair my skin. I have been using this moisturizer for four years now and don’t ever plan on stopping.##ENDING##

If I could only use one skincare product for the rest of my life I would choose this moisturizer. Take away all of my oils, serums, face masks, I'll wash my face with just water - I don't care! Just as long as I can put the URC on once a day I feel like my skin will survive and thrive. 

Also you really can't beat this kinda price per oz of product for a moisturizer at Sephora... just sayin.##ENDING##

LIFE SAVER
My skin became immensely dry this winter and this product saved my life. The most amazing thing about it is how soothing it is to irritated skin. It immediately relieves itchiness of the face and helps with the redness. My face has been severely chapped in some areas and this cleared it right up. This has been the best product I've used all winter.##ENDING##

Great for very dry skin
I have very dry skin and this has been probably the best product I've used on my face! It's expensive enough where you know it's going to be high-quality, but cheap enough where you can lather onto your face and let it soak in. I bought one for my sister and mom as well!##ENDING##

Moisturizes but not best for sensitive skin
Feels very soft and creamy, definitely hydrates my skin instantly after putting it on. Smells nice, but I have slightly sensitive skin so the eucalyptus oil that contributes to the aroma in this makes my face burn despite the soothing colloidal oatmeal. I will be using it mostly other areas of my skin besides my face for this reason.##ENDING##

I read the reviews about how awesome it is, but sadly it was such a disappointment. First, it doesn’t absorb quickly so you really have to massage it in. Then once it turns from a white paste to something translucent, it peels off like skin. I had to wash it off because i wasn’t going to put foundation on top of it. The only good thing was that it was scent-free.##ENDING##

Awesome for winter dry skin
This is the third year I have used this cream.  Winters in the North are very hard on skin.  The cream keeps my skin soft and smooth.

I am in love with this stuff. My skin is dry, sensitive and red and this cream helps so much - especially in the winter. I even keep some in my desk for my hands when they get chapped by Midwestern winds! If you have oily skin, maybe start out with it lightly - it is thick and rich.##ENDING##

This moisturizer has really calmed down and moisturized my itchy, tight, red, and breakout prone sensitive skin. Thank you minimal and effective ingredients!

favorite moisturizer ever!
I switched to this product after seeing Kathleenlights mention it. I was concerned because she has dry skin and I have oily, but I have truly never loved a moisturizer more. It doesn’t make me look greasy during the day or the next morning when I use it at night. I use it with my Kiehl’s midnight recovery concentrate and my skin has never looked better. 

Plus! I can tell that my forehead lines are diminishing!! 

I’m glad I bought the value size because I absolutely love this product.##ENDING##

-30 Below and Hydrated ASF

It saved my chemically burned cheeks!
I am a very impatient person and despite knowing that doing a patch test with a new product is necessary, I will skip it if it seems normal. (Don’t make the same mistakes that I do, please.) So, I tried a new mask and, to make a long story short, the tops of my cheeks were warm, red, dry, and obviously chemically burned. I typically only use gel-cream moisturizers but I knew I needed something more nourishing and gentle than my usuals so I went through my skincare drawer and found this gem that I’d been sent in a subscription box some time before. I washed my face with a gentle cleanser and slathered this on before bed. I woke up and my face looked so hydrated (and maybe slightly oily because that’s my skin type) and didn’t feel nearly as bad as it had the night before. I did the same routine, morning and night, for the next two days and I haven’t stopped using it since. If I’m going to wear makeup, I’ll usually use a lighter moisturizer in the morning and this at night because it is heavier and I naturally have oily skin! I highly recommend this for a gentle, very hydrating moisturizer.##ENDING##

four years of magic
I have been using this only first aid now for four years. When I first started my skin went through a purge (1-2 weeks, it’s normal) and now it’s magic. I use this almost every night (especially after I shower, if I do it at night) and if I had acne... it’s gone or reduced by morning. It’s thick but feels light. I live in AZ and when it’s hot, it can feel a little oily, but only because it’s like 90-110. I would recommend all their products together. Especially this one, use with the cleanser it’s magic.##ENDING##

Balls up and pills, what to do???
I don’t like to write negative reviews but...
I have tried every way I can think of to use this on my well balanced, normal to dry skin but it pills and balls up every time. It doesn’t matter what order, what time of day, what part of my body, it pills and balls up every time. At first I’ll think, “ok, it’s soaking in!” But nope, give it 20 minutes and bits are falling off of my face, and if I rub my face, I can practically just rub it off with little greasy chunks of moisturizer falling all over. 
Of much lesser importance, I don’t like the smell. It would not prevent me from using it and I don’t mind fragrances in my cosmetics (I know that I should), but it’s too sweet and gags me just a bit. 

I’m mostly writing this because I want to find out if anyone knows how to make this sink into the skin?##ENDING##

Not that hydrating
This might be "intense hydration" for folks who normally use light gel moisturizers. For me, it was not nearly hydrating enough for cold wintertime use. I like the texture and it has not made me break out, so I might pull it back out for the summer months.##ENDING##

The Must Have All Purpose Cream
I just absolutely love this cream. I discovered it 2 1/2 yrs ago. It is perfect for everything. The kind of hydration you get from this is just a nice, rich, non greasy moisture. Like getting water injections. I typically love the heavier creams because my dry skin can really make me look lifeless and dehydrated but that exactly what this is good for. I use this under drunk a retinol & elephant oil. I wake up with baby soft skin.##ENDING##

a must have for northerners
CANNOT say enough good things. i lived in the south my whole life with perfect skin, then i moved to chicago to find the air dried out my skin like crazy. i was breaking out all on my chin and around my mouth due to dryness. it seemed similar to eczema but it wasnt. i tried multiple products that did nothing. anyways i purchased a set of first aid beauty. cleanser, radience pads, moisturizer, oatmeal mask, and serum. i only use the serum and mask once a week. these products have completely cured my dry skin and seriously it just makes me so happy after having such dry and unhappy skin for months. this is the best my skin has ever looked.##ENDING##

good for normal skin
this cream is a good everyday moistirizer. I don't know about the staying power though, I find myself reapplying more than I would like because my skin eats it up and then it feels normal again.

smells terrible
This stuff smells TERRIBLE. It’s technically “fragrance free”, but it NEEDS fragrance to cover that awful smell up. I could probably get past that if it was a good product, but it’s not. It’s not super hydrating like it claims to be. It does absorb into the skin, but it leaves a chalky feel behind. I tried to make myself use it up, but I ended up throwing away over half the tub.##ENDING##

This cream was too heavy for my combination skin, and caused me to break out in small bumps. I’m sure it would work great for someone with a ton of dryness or eczema, but it wasn’t for me. I’ve been trying a moisturizer from Belif that is better suited for me I think!##ENDING##

one of the best moisturizers!
I was one of those who believes the myth that only expensive product works until I purchased this cream. My face was very dry, red and irritated in the past few months. I have tried a lot of expensive products but nothing helps me.  I read the review of this cream and it claims to repair eczema so I gave it a try. It is a holy grail cream! The second day I used it I could feel a huge difference. I am on day 5 now and my whole face is calmed, moisturized and redness free! This is the first time I wrote a review. If you experience any dryness or sensitivity issues, this is a must have facial cream for you!##ENDING##

I love this moisturizer so much. I have extremely dry skin on my body during the winter and this definitely helps. If I skip a day I can tell a huge difference. Without it, my skin feels tight and it flakes.

Got this in a kit and tried it tonight after applying my prescription tretinoin cream.  Normally I have to prepare for a feeling of tightness and peeling, but I applied a thin layer, not sure if this was intended for the face, and my face feels GREAT now!  It did not make my face feel greasy at all.  It's like a nice sleeping mask on "normal" days when I haven't applied anything potentially irritating, or when it's not cold and dry outside.  Will update if there are negative effects, but so far so good!##ENDING##

Love nearly everything about this product. I went in to the store asking for a thicker moisturizer and the consultant let me to this. I LOVE the price point and how well this works. It’s not too thick and goopy, it’s a perfect consistency that seems like it will last me a long time! I can tell a noticeable difference in my skin in just 2 weeks. My face looks brighter and is so much softer. I’ve even used it a few times on my 4 year olds face that dries out from the cold Midwest winters!  This will definitely be a staple for me!##ENDING##

Got it a couple months back since a Sephora employee saw that I had parched peeling skin due to the cold weather in nyc and needed intense hydration.

Winter wreaks havoc on my sensitive, acne prone skin. I had used a new foundation that went from liquid to powder and it really irritated my skin.

Hands down the best moisturizer
I absolutely love this product and this line! I have oily skin in the summer and lean more dry in the winter, I use this cream on my face at night and under my makeup as needed for extra hydration. I also have sensitive skin and I have allergy induced eczema. I know that is quite a list of issues that could not vary more. However, I use this product and it takes care of everything! I travel to Florida a lot and don't need my allergy medicine down there, but when I come back to Missouri my allergies are so much worse. I use this on my eczema flare ups and they are gone in a matter of days. This cream takes care of the itching, the rough skin and the redness. It really is a cure all cream. I could not live without it. I started buying it for my mom who is elderly and has very sensitive skin as well and she loves it too! It is a must try!##ENDING##

Heals Burns
Definitely a First Aid Supply here. This heals damaged or burned skin almost overnight. If I ever accidentally chemical burn my skin again, I will definitely do a before and after photo comparison.

Pretty good
I bought my first aid beauty ultra repair cream intense hydration on Black Friday. $12-18 (I can't remember) and 12oz. I can say that it was probably the best purchase I've ever made on any Black Friday.

That being said, I find the cream very very heavy and generally use it at night. If you prefer a more matte look, this cream is not for you.

It's a nice cream, it just doesn't leave me in shock and awe (hence 4 out of 5 stars and not 5), but it's nice at night and good for dry days. I'd recommend buying it, especially if you have dry skin.##ENDING##

Little goes a long way
I have been using this continually for a month and have found it has not irritated my skin and has no scent. At first the way it left a white sheen reminded me of sunscreen but this immediately disappears after the cream absorbs. With my skin which tends to be more oily, only a little is needed (applying too much makes my face feel and look a bit oily/greasy). It applies easily across skin, so for those with drier skin and live in colder climates this may be definitely worth trying.##ENDING##

So, his skin is beyond repair at this point—so that if he should scratch an itch during winter (just a scratch), he breaks the skin and starts bleeding. But, this right here helped save him when I forced him to use it! It absorbs very easily, is non greasy, and it has been working on damage accumulated over 10 years (with once a day use, over the course of 1.5 weeks)! Upon first use, you can already feel your skin softening. It’s also been working wonders on my old scars and discolorations! A very big bonus for me too is that it’s been so moisturizing on my face! My face is soft and balanced for a good 10 hours after using this to help me against dry, Southern California winters!##ENDING##

My favorite lotion
My absolute favorite lotion ever! I have very dry skin and some rough patches on my face or elbow occasionally and this works wonders for both! It absorbs well, doesn't smell and isn't greasy.  My skin is a combo of oily, dry, sensitive and acne prone and this stuff doesn't irritate me at all.  It's pricey for me because I typically buy one every month and a half to two months. Expensive for lotion, but worth it.##ENDING##

This is a high potent moisturizer and great for dry winter months! I had recently had a chemical burn from a reaction to an exfoliate and to put this on my face was like a kiss from an angel!

Best thing for my super dry sensitive skin. I have tried so many creams and moisturizers and this is what I always go back to because it is the only thing that seems to work.

Better for Body-Not Face
I have mild eczema that can become severe at times. My eczema is dictated by the environment, so its common that I wake up in the morning with dry, scaly, patchy skin.
I bought this moisturizer thinking I could use it for my face, but I really can't. For me, it's best used on my body.  If I try and use it on a dry patch or when I have just exfoliated my face and have an open wound/abrasion then this moisturizer will burn the affected area. So if your facial skin is similar to mine, air on the side of caution if your face is feeling super dry and flaky.##ENDING##

OK but pills like crazy
This product has a very strong herbal/medicinal scent which can be off-puffing to some. This also reminds me A LOT of the Cerave moisturizer that comes in a tub. So overall I think save your money and get that one because they have identical textures and sink into the skin the same. This cream also pills like CRAZY so really be careful and try not to rub your face after applying because it will just slip right off. It’s still an ok cream just nothing that special.##ENDING##

Odor: very strong herbal/medicinal scent, reminds me A LOT of Cerave

Holy Grail

I never leave reviews but I have to tell everyone how great this product is. I have extremely dry skin especially in the winter. Just turning on the heat in the winter dries out my skin so badly. I would get rough dry patches all over my face. I have tried SO many moisturizers, sleeping masks, and oils and nothing has worked. I wasted a lot of money in hopes of finding a solution to my dry skin. I stumbled upon this product and I am so glad I did. I saw a huge difference after just one day of using it. It soaks into your skin and moisturizes your skin. I’ve been using it for a week and I have no more dry patches and it leaves my skin so smooth. Definitely worth a try!##ENDING##

My holy grail Face moisturizer
This is my go-to solves everything face moisturizer. Irritated, chapped, raw, dry, combo or plain sensitive skin? It handles it all. I’ve used a lot of face moisturizers but none have been this moisturizing while also not clogging my pores or feeling too greasy. My face is acne prone/combo & sensitive, w a super dry nose, super oily forehead. I don’t use this on my body unless I have a rashy/dry area bc it’s expensive. The biggest size of this lasts me a year for my face. 3rd time repurchasing!##ENDING##

Holy Grail Year-Round Night Cream
Up until discovering FAB's Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration moisturizer, I veered straight away from any and all heavier creams in fear that they would make my oilier parts even oilier. On a whim last holiday season I decided to pick up a small jar of it just to use on my cheeks and neck which, especially as I've gotten a bit older, tend to get pretty dry during the winter months. For the first few weeks, I only used it on my dry areas in conjunction with a lighter moisturizer on my t-zone and noticed a massive difference in the feel and look of those areas. No more rough texture, no more small flakes, nothing. One day, just "for science", I decided to see what it would be like to try the cream on my entire face, oily spots included. 

I woke up the next morning absolutely amazed by how soft and oil-free my entire face was. Normally with my lightweight moisturizers, I'd wake up and my forehead and nose would already be shiny. I assumed that was just always going to be the case. As it turns out, my skin was actually overproducing oils to counteract how parched it was!

I now use the FAB Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration all over my face every single night, even in the summer, and always wake up with baby soft skin. It does take a moment to soak in and I do look pretty greasy for a little while after applying it, which is obviously not a problem when I'm heading right to bed, but it is for that reason why I don't also wear it as my day cream. I'm sure that for those who have dry or combo-dry skin that wouldn't be as much of an issue though!

Highly recommend for anyone who feels like they need an extra boost of moisture, regardless of skin type!##ENDING##


 Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: moisturizer, dry, extra boost of moisture

True to its name
I've strayed from this moisturizer for three years and recently tried it again and have NO idea why I ever made a change; maybe to try something new, maybe because I thought expensive meant better. Regardless, I've been paying more attention to the ingredients and this line doesn't have any of the toxic ingredients compared to other highly rated more pricey brands. The consistency is not too thick, and it quickly absorbs into the skin. I also love that this doesn't smell heavy and has no fragrance added. It's definitely worth a try if you're considering buying this.##ENDING##

Price: this line doesn't have any of the toxic ingredients compared to other highly rated more pricey brands
Odor: doesn't smell heavy

Be cautious when using it on your face
Ok so after trying for a good month on my face specifically I do see it helped moisturize HOWEVER it caused small whiteheads and textured skin! I have acne prone skin so that may be the reason. I gave this cream a try on my hands and legs that have eczema and it works great! Just not on my face. Will continue to use on my body.##ENDING##

Wonderful hand lotion!
I fell in love with this after receiving a small tube in a subscription box. I ordered the 8 oz. tube and keep it in my desk drawer at work. I wash my hands a lot during the winter months due to co-workers' "sharing and not caring" illnesses. My hands need extra love and this works wonderfully! Very moisturizing and actually can survive a couple of hand washings before reapplication.##ENDING##

A must-have in my home!
This is a must-have in my home. My son and I both have eczema and dry skin, and we both swear by the Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration. So much so that we have our own 8oz tubes. I love how it soaks into my skin, and it doesn't make it feel greasy. It soothes my dry itchy skin and it helps so much that I rarely need cortisone for our eczema flare-ups. I enjoy the very light natural scent, as well. I tell EVERYONE about this all the time!##ENDING##

Drying on my face.  Works as a body cream.
This seems to work as a body cream for me, but not as a face cream.  It is actually strangely drying on my face.  It is nice to have a body cream I can wear that is unscented, though.  So I'll continue to use it that way, but would probably not purchase again.##ENDING##

Skin: strangely drying on my face

Really helps!
Love this lotion. It smells great and definitely leaves my skin feeling hydrated and soft! I frequently have red and irritated skin, especially my stomach and chest. Using this product at least a few times a week has really helped that! It’s expensive but as long as it seems to last a good enough time for me, I will repurchase with out a doubt!##ENDING##

Very thick and hydrating without feeling sticky. The 6 oz jar is pretty big and lasts a long time, definitely a good price point compared to other high end thick moisturizers. I would say this is comparable to Lala Whipped face cream by Drunk Elephant. Bonus that this can be used on other places of your body like dry elbows. The only thing I wish I could change is the smell, it reminds me of a prescribed face cream from my dermatologist. Smells very medicated if that makes sense.##ENDING##

Awful smell!!
This is the worse moisturizer I have ever used. It smelled old!! I called customer service and they were not interested in listening to me.

THE BEST
this is literally THE BEST face moisturizer ever. It is a "clean" product and doesn't have a lot of added junk. Even though it's fragrance free it still has a very fresh, natural smell to it. I use it every morning and night. I even stopped using my Rodan and Fields moisturizer because I love this one so much. It's super light yet moisturizes your skin so well. When I apply it after washing my face it feels like a facial every time! I will never use any other moisturizer.##ENDING##

FAB is FAB
Usually I won’t write review for any of the products. I started using this product from past 6 months knowing it is free from sulphate and all. 2 oz  tube used to last for me for 2 months, twice a day. It lasts for long. Recently I have started using it on my body. Omg it helped with my allergy, it started disappearing. I used to suffer with allergy during winters. This product helped more than anything. I am really great-full to this product. I think buying 8 oz will save money if you are using it on body too.

Great as a hand team in Winter months
I bought this in the pink grapefruit scent. It smells amazing and so refreshing without being overwhelming or competing with my perfume.

Amazing. You won't regret it.
Would give this cream 10 stars if I could. Perfect for parched sensitive skin.  bought it when I was 14 weeks pregnant and my skin suddenly went crazy flakey dry (with acne!). This helped so much! I got the travel size that was $15 and used it every day. I take it to the gym for after I swim and slather it all over my face and hands. Ive had no acne issues and it makes my skin so soft. I have VERY sensitive eyes (sooooo many products will cause severe swelling) but I can run this right under my eyes and wake up with the softest skin. Oh and I live in a dry climate in Canada in the winter so I can attest that it's holding up under the harshest conditions.##ENDING##

best moisturizer!!!
This is a lifesaver. I bought this moisturizer a few years ago when I was struggling with dry, irritated skin from acne treatments. I was skeptical because of the thick formula and was scared it would break me out but I was completely wrong! This moisturizer is the best I have ever tried and I will never buy another. If you have sensitive skin, acne, dry patches, or even oily skin, this product is perfect. It locks in moisture all day and doesn't make the skin oily, and soothes skin when it is irritated. Also, this jar is huge and lasts me for almost a year (I use it morning and night.) HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!##ENDING##

Favorite winter cream!
As someone with dehydrated skin living in New England, the winter time is awful to my skin. I decided to try this out on my face and neck during the winter months, morning and night and was amazed. Not only did it hydrate and plump my skin, but it deeply conditioned it so that there were no dry patches or damage from the cold. I use this every winter, a little goes a long way and this jar lasted me 6 months.##ENDING##

I have very sensitive skin with a huge problem of blackheads, dryness, and texture on my nose. I tend to get oily on my forehead and chin. I have never come across a moisturizer to work all over that wasn’t too greasy but still worked on my whole face without breaking me out. It provides much needed moisture without being too heavy.##ENDING##

None

Positive: 
Skin: very sensitive skin, problem of blackheads

I have combo skin that is more dry in the winter. I tried this as an AM moisturizer and will never again. I wore no makeup all day and every time I touched my face I felt like an oil slick because the product never fully absorbed and made me so greasy. By the time I washed my face again that night I had three giant pimples on my chin and jawline. Might be ok for you if you don't have acne prone skin, but beware. Bummed this didn't work because of all the hype around it and the price is right.##ENDING##


 Positive: 
Motivation: all the hype around it

Negative: 
Skin: combo skin that is more dry, acne prone skin
Application: tried this as an AM moisturizer
Texture: every time I touched my face I felt like an oil slick

Best Black Friday Purchase EVER
I have acne prone skin and this works amazing for healing open zits as well as scabbed over zits. I do not have eczema, but it works so good all the same and has helped in calming redness and irritation. Got the 12oz tub on black Friday at the mall after slathering on a sample and loved it. My face is looking better by the day. Scabs have healed over and recent scarring has faded. A little bit goes a long way. I have oily skin so even on the driest of cold days I find myself having to use just a teeny tiny amount as too much can make your face greasy. Awesome for healing over mild body acne too! This was probably the best black Friday purchase I've ever made.##ENDING##


 Positive: 
Skin: acne prone skin, calming redness and irritation, Scabs have healed over, recent scarring has faded, mild body acne too
Demographic: black Friday at the mall

SO GOOD
I love this. Great for everywhere on your body but especially the face- I have combination,  acne-prone skin and it hydrated wonderfully without clogging my pores or making my acne worse. Doesn't make your face oily or greasy either. I got a sample and had to go back and buy the whole thing.##ENDING##

Skin: combination, acne-prone skin, hydrated wonderfully, Doesn't make your face oily or greasy

amazing for the back of hands during winter months
works AMAZINGLY to instantly sooth and heal painful chapped hands.  so many other types of hand moisturizers sting or sometimes cause me to have a reaction with redness, rash, and bumps (even the ones from whole foods) if that happens to you, you need this cream.  can't live without it in my bag during the winter months.##ENDING##

great!
I really love this lotion. I recently bought the 8 oz one after trying a 1 oz sample and I fell in love. I have (cystic) acne prone skin. I break out regardless of what products I use but this lotion is not making it worse! I love using it under my makeup. the only reason I'm giving it 4/5 stars is because it gets greasy after some hours, mostly around my T-zone##ENDING##

Skin: (cystic) acne prone skin

Texture: gets greasy after some hours

Amazing product for skin allergies/reactions. I had an extremely flaky, scratchy, irritated patch of skin under my eye that wasn’t healing past a week. I bought this for that purpose and it softened, repaired, & calmed the redness within a few days if even. For an everyday moisturizer on oily skin like mine, it might be too heavy. Still hydrates and absorbs well. I don’t write reviews but this definitely deserved one. Highly recommend.##ENDING##

Be careful if you’re allergic to anything in the Asteraceae/Compositae family as you may react to the chrysanthemum in this product. Lesson learned on my part. Other than that ingredient, I do believe everything else to be pretty good.##ENDING##

Not as smooth/soft on me!
The product is very thick. Scent is alright. But upon applying it, my hands and face feel... sticky? I don't know how to describe it or use the right word. If I glide my hand against the other, it's not smooth. I was expecting soft, supple skin but the ingredients are very heavy in this product so I should have known better. Maybe gel cream is better for my face because this is too thick for me!##ENDING##


 Negative: 
Texture: product is very thick., my hands and face feel... sticky
Odor: scent is alright.
Application: but upon applying it,

Great Body Moisturizer
I have combo/oily skin and this is much too thick for my face. It made me break out. The Coconut Water Cream is so much better and I'll stick to using that as my go-to face moisturizer. HOWEVER, the Ultra Repair Cream works great as a body/dry patch moisturizer! My boyfriend gets really dry skin on his elbows, knees, and hands. I introduced him to this stuff and he can't get enough! It works better than most other "body lotions" without that greasy and sticky feeling. There isn't any overpowering smell, either!##ENDING##


 Negative: 
Skin: combo/oily skin
Allergy: made me break out

Positive: 
Competitor: Ultra Repair Cream works great as a body/dry patch moisturizer, better than most other "body lotions"

This is amazing!!! I love it because it helps me a lot with my acne! I have dry acne prone skin and this cream hydrates my skin while helps me to reduce my acne. It’s thick but it’s not oily at all, doesn’t have a strong scent, and it’s fragrance and parabens free!##ENDING##

Got this as a sample with one of my previous purchases and had to get the full size. I’ve been searching for a winter moisturizer because my skin has been flaky and dry. This is the best thing out of all the ones I’ve tried. A bit pricey but a little goes a long way so I see this lasting a very long time.##ENDING##
