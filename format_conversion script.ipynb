      "I've been using this cream for maybe a year. I bought the 6oz tub and am now considering repurchasing it. I like this cream because it is very dependable. My skin is sensitive, and freaks out easily: I have been dealing with hormonal acne in the past few years and I also suffer from eczema. I have had short flings with other moisturizers, but I always return to this one because it is so gentle and calming and I know it won't cause my skin to freak out. Also the value is unbeatable. I feel the ingredients are high quality, and it is much cheaper than several other moisturizers on Sephora. If it helped with my acne I would give it 5 stars. But, it certainly does not cause acne or make it worse, so I have been continuing to use it. The cream is super moisturizing but I do not feel it is too heavy for my skin and it doesn't seem to clog pores. I use it all over my face before bed and it does not feel greasy. Sensitive, eczema prone skin is definitely the best crowd for this moisturizer.\n",

Its on the heavier side, which I would normally shy away from, but this cream absorbs very well into my skin, leaving it feeling calm and soft. It has also never caused an acne flare up for me and instead seems to calm my skin. \n",
      "Before using this product my face was a mess of volcanic acne eruptions, complete with dark acne scars. \"Skin care\" for me meant scrubbing my face a thousand times a day and using every face mask under the sun. I stopped all that thank goodness, and started to treat my skin gently. This has worked wayyy better than bouncing between products and trying new harsh scrubs every other week. I now treat my skin as if it is sensitive and have a true routine using just a few products.  This product is key to that, and I use it night and day and night to protect my skin and calm any redness and irritation. I would definitely recommend trying this product - even if you don't end up loving it for your face, its great to use on your hands (especially because I'm washing them so often now). Each tub lasts a crazy long time too so the price is worth it.\n",

I never had skin problems so it was driving me nuts. I even tried applying aloe plant but it was just sticky and messy. Read reviews on this product and thought “it won’t hurt to try”. After applying it the first night, I saw a difference right away. The redness gone and my lids wasn’t bumpy and dry.  The second day, I noticed my face was going back to normal. I’m very thankful for this product. It’s now my daily/night moisturizer. I’ll recommend this to anyone with dry or redness problems. It def helped my skin and now I’m going to buy try their other products. Thank you First Aid Beauty!!\n",
