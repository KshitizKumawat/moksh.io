##Disastrous formula change.

I've been using this FAB cream for almost a decade. I have spent thousands of dollars on just this one cream - I've got a whole family with sensitive skin and we live in an area with very harsh winters. We've bought uncounted tubes and tubs of this stuff (as well as now-discontinued fragrances, rip coconut lime). This used to be the absolute best cream you could buy for a variety of concerns - dry skin, acne, eczema, flakiness, EVERYTHING. The scent was pleasant and the texture, once it sunk in, left your skin actually soft but never greasy and weird. Holy Grail, totally deserving of every accolade it received. 

Welp. Over the last year that's almost all changed. The fragrance is more or less the same, but I suddenly noticed my hands and face weren't staying as nice as they used to. My family agrees: the cream isn't soothing eczema or flakiness anymore, nor helping prevent dryness. The texture is no longer thick and luscious but feels watery and insubstantial when applied. Once it's rubbed in, skin now seems mildly tacky, not soft or moisturized. Any sensation of moisture wears off quickly. 

I can't tell what they've done to the formula besides the addition of eucalyptus, but it is a catastrophic change. This product used to be five stars, now it's one. A pump bottle of any drugstore brand with oatmeal will serve you much better. I also want to note they have raised the price on the 8oz tube by TWELVE DOLLARS over the last six years - and I'd still be willing to pay if it wasn't worse than a drugstore product. But as it stands I'm heartbroken. Don't waste your money.

##Best by far

I got this while it was on sale to try and wish I bought more! I've tried gold bond cream to l'occitaine cream and this is by far the best. Not greasy but keeps your hands supple. I work in health care and wash my hands so much. This has been amazing for the winter dryness as well. Cannot recommend enough.


Negative: 
Competitor: l'occitaine cream

Positive: 
Motivation: was on sale
Texture: Not greasy
Skin: wash my hands, dryness
Demographic: winter
##A must have for sensitive skin, till you react!

When I used the product for many months, I didn't have any issues and it did moisturize well. I even used it on my baby's skin and it helped. However, after a few months, it felt like I got sensitive to one of the ingredients (probably the eucalyptus) and got pimples on and off when using the product. Also, after a point I felt like it didn't leave me moisturized for a few hours later, just right after. I think it might be a hit or miss.


Positive: 
Skin: sensitive

Negative: 
Allergy: eucalyptus) and got pimples
Skin: didn't leave me moisturized for a few hours
##Used to be great product 3+ years ago, not anymore

Let me start by saying I loved this product so much when I first started using it. My hands, especially during winter, tend to crack and bleed at the knuckles and cuticles especially. I finally caved and bought the ultra repair cream. It was amazing! The cream was thick, absorbing relatively quickly. It did cause a little burning at first because my hands were so dry and cracked. That subsided after 10 minutes max. I finally saw my skin looking normal and it did take away the small eczema-looking patch on my arm within a week. I was so amazed by this cream, I stocked up and would have anywhere from 5-10+ 14oz jars on hand at any given time and also bought this every year for Christmas for family and friends.

Then I started to noticed the formula was becoming thinner and not working as well as it used to. I noticed my skin going back to the way it was. 

Then the price got outrageous $78 for a 14oz jar? Seems a little excessive for how much cream I was having to use. Then it was getting harder and harder to get their TSV on time for Christmas. Or even at all,  I had it on autodelivery for the Christmas pear fragrance and waited 2 months after it was supposed to ship and kept getting the run around. I finally cancelled it because I got sick of waiting and I haven’t bought another product from them since. Then they stopped selling it! So I ended up going back to my old lotions that were less than 1/2 the price for more product.

##hydration is key

##Worth it! Calms rosacea

I have rosacea and super sensitive skin and I wanted a moisturizer I could use daily that wouldn’t aggravate my skin, but rather calm it down a bit. Enter this cream: at first, I didn’t think it did anything at all, but the more I used it, the smoother my skin got (less texture from the rosacea) and I saw a different in my redness on my face. As soon as you apply it to irritated and hot skin, it’s so cooling and feels so nice! I use it after Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and it feels great. Also, for the person who said that this is just a more expensive version of Cerave — I disagree. Not all moisturizers work for everyone — for some reason, Cerave doesn’t work well at all with my skin, but FAB ultra hydrating cream truly does soothe it. Worth the price for the tub because I’ve only used about 1/5th of it and I’ve been using it every day for about 3 months now!


Negative: 
Competitor: Cerave doesn’t work well at all with my skin

Positive: 
Motivation: wouldn’t aggravate my skin, calm it down a bit

##Must Have for Dry Skin!

I’ve been a fan of FAV for years. I use the face moisturizer exclusively, and I swear by the cleanser. I tried this moisturizer and it did wonders for my skin! I am a touch oily in my t zone, but I’m dry everywhere else  this left me feeling not just moisturized, but nourished. The moisture lasted a long time and I didn’t have any flakes I usually experience or cracks. This is a love for me. else. This left me


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: Dry Skin, not just moisturized, but nourished
Texture: moisture lasted a long time
Performance: didn’t have any flakes I usually experience
##peeling

Ive been using this everyday for about a month its very moisturizing and feels great when applying but, if you apply too much or if you you don’t wait long enough to apply other products it peels right off when you touch your face


Positive: 
Skin: its very moisturizing

Negative: 
Texture: peels right off when you touch your face
##Great for Mature Skin!

I got this for my mom who has been searching for a deeply moisturizing and protective cream because she lives in a dry climate. She absolutely loves this cream! For the price, it’s a fantastic formula and large size. I knew she was going to be slathering this on and she said her skin just drinks it up.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Demographic: got this for my mom, dry climate
Skin: deeply moisturizing
Price: the price, it’s a fantastic formula
Packaging: large size
Texture: her skin just drinks it up
##Not for me anymore

Here’s the deal: this is a good product. I do recommend people try this if they’re looking for a cream for sensitive/damaged skin. This used to be great for my skin when it was stressed and dry, and it was my go to moisturizer to use with retinol, but out of nowhere it started to pill no matter where I used it or what I used it with. I’d go to sleep with it on and when I’d wake up, it looked like my pillow was covered in dead skin flakes from how much it pilled during the night. It’s such a bummer because I really did love it.


Positive: 
Skin: sensitive/damaged skin, skin when it was stressed and dry

Negative: 
Application: Not for me anymore
Allergy: started to pill no matter where I used it
##Simple and clean, perfect everyday moisturizer

This is a great everyday moisturizer that is clean and simple and hydrating. A staple in my skin care routine, would highly recommend for people with dry to normal skin as it is very hydrating but it’s not oily so could work for any skin type! MUST BUY!


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: great everyday moisturizer, simple and hydrating, dry to normal skin
Texture: but it’s not oily so
##Instant Hydration

Starting using this Ultra Repair cream because my skin was very dry and irritated and it is super creamy, hydrating, and soothing! It is instant hydration and helped my dry skin after the first use! It doesn’t feel sticky either, It feels amazing and I would highly recommend.


Positive: 
Skin: nstant Hydration, hydrating, soothing, instant hydration
Sentiment: Ultra Repair cream, would highly recommend
Performance: dry and irritated, helped my dry skin
Texture: super creamy,, doesn’t feel sticky either

I used this cream a few times for my face but it didn’t work well with my other face treatments, it started to pill, but I love it as a body cream


Positive: 
Application: Great body cream, love it as a body cream

Allergy: No rednes, no breakouts
Skin: normal to dry skin

Negative: 
Skin: o not recommend if u have oily skin
##Amazing!!!

I have combo skin, and this was perfect as a night cream for me. I realized that my skin was needing more hydration at night. This is the best. I also use it on my dry body as a body lotion. I recommend!


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: combo skin, my dry body as a body lotion
Demographic: perfect as a night cream
##Not The Best

I was not impressed with this. I have very dry skin and got it to use on my face, and it was just OKAY, but didn’t seem to do much for my dry patches. Nothing to cry home about. I wasn’t huge on the smell, but that’s something pretty easy to look past. What I REALLY didn’t like is that when rubbing it in, the moisturizer would pill up, like it was sort of separating or something if I rubbed it in for too long. Not a horrible product, but I don’t recommend it and I will not be purchasing it again.


Positive: 
None

Negative: 
Skin: very dry skin
Odor: wasn’t huge on the smell
Allergy: moisturizer would pill up
Sentiment: Not a horrible product
Purchase: not be purchasing it again
##sensitive skin is tough to manage

It works really well for my sensitive skin, it's not perfect but it works good enough. I like that it doesn't have a fragrance and soaks in, but my skin is still dry after use so I mix in a little q10 or rosehip for some added moisture and that helps.


Positive: 
Skin: sensitive skin
Odor: doesn't have a fragrance

Negative: 
Skin: still dry after use
##super super good

I love this stuff so much, my skin was good but it was missing something and this repair cream makes my skin barrier very happy every night.


Positive: 
Performance: repair cream makes my skin barrier

Negative: 
None
##Not greasy!

I have been using this for a week and I love it so far! It hydrates and moistures skin without leaving your face feeling greasy. It does burn a little when you first apply it, but it goes away pretty quickly and its not too bothersome. I will definitely be purchasing again!


Positive: 
Texture: Not greasy!
Skin: moistures skin without
Purchase: definitely be purchasing again

Negative: 
None
##Burning Sensation

I was really looking forward to using this because i’ve heard nothing but good things. Recently I’ve been over exfoliating and messed up my skin barrier, so I bought this to supplement my new routine to remedy it. Very thick and moisturizing, but I noticed that my skin felt like it was burning on first application. I thought nothing of it, but after trying it again 2 more times, I’m sure it’s this product. Maybe I’ll wait until my skin barrier has healed to give it another try.


Negative: 
Allergy: Burning Sensation, my skin felt like it was burning

Positive: 
Skin: thick and moisturizing
##ABSOLUTE NO!!

This cream is very lightweight and has a whipped texture. It smells like oats which was weird in the beginning  but I got used to it. It is intended for dry to very dry skin however I didn’t find it hydrating enough. I used it from september to march so basically winter and it wasn’t cut out for this weather. See its ingredients include oat, ceramides, niacinamide, and MANY silicones. The problem with this was that the cream left this residue which was clearly due to the silicones. It was very fast absorbing and I needed alot of product in order to feel moisturized. When I washed my face it felt like there was a layer of cream sitting there so I didn’t like that at all. Also, I think because of the niacinamide there was a BURNING sensation for many days when I first started using it but I got used to it eventually. I’ve never had a cream that lasted me such a short time. I think this cream would suit summers cuz it wasn’t enough for the winter here and summers here get very humid so it would literally just melt off cuz of the silicones. There were many times I outright hated how it made my skin feel so I don’t think I would use it again.

Ingredients: oat, ceramides, niacinamide
Texture: very fast absorbing

##life Saver!

I have struggled with finding skin care products that doesn’t take a layer of my skin off. Even the products my dermatologist gave me burned my skin. Almost like a sunburn and it would last for weeks. On top of having rosacea flare ups my skin looked terrible but I was terrified to try any new products. I finally pulled the trigger on this moisturizer. I pair this with the pure skin face cleanser and the ultra repair wild out hydrating toner and my skin has started to look amazing for the first time in my life. I have had less and less rosacea flare ups.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Motivation: having rosacea flare ups, less and less rosacea flare ups

Application: use it on my face

##perfect moisturizer

I got this (the normal 6oz size) in their holiday set and I've used it every day, twice a day, since mid-January. It's mid-July and I still have about another 2 weeks worth of product in there - you absolutely get your money's worth on this stuff. I have normal to oily skin and find that it's rich but not heavy, lightly herbally scented (didn't bother my skin, might bother yours), and layers fine with other products. Just don't leave the lid unscrewed overnight - it'll solidify the top layer which is gross.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Motivation: in their holiday set
Packaging: another 2 weeks worth of product
Price: your money's worth
Skin: normal to oily
Texture: rich but not heavy
Odor: lightly herbally scented
##disappointed

I use retinol every other day and my skin has gotten a bit drier from it so I wanted to try this and even though it says it’s good for sensitive skin it still ended up burning my face so bad that I had to wash it off


Positive: 
Competitor: retinol every other day

Negative: 
Allergy: ended up burning my face
##will give you skin issues

If you have acne prone skin or don’t want to deal with breakouts stay away. I never really had issues with acne until using this product. It took me months to get my skin back to normal. Luckily I don’t scar easily. You can get better moisturizers that don’t break you out.


Negative: 
Skin: acne prone skin
Allergy: deal with breakout

Positive: 
None
##A cult classic you should try

It’s only my second favorite moisturizing cream, but it still gets a strong five stars. I loved the slightly whipped but still creamy texture, and it’s excellent bang for your buck. I love the whole concept behind FAB. 
Their oatmeal mask is one of my holy grail products that I never travel without. I think it might have been discontinued, but in any case, FAB knows how to deliver when it comes to moisture.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Texture: slightly whipped but still creamy texture
Price: excellent bang for your buck
Brand: love the whole concept behind FAB
##HOLY GRAIL PRODUCT

when i say i love this moisturizer…i mean i would date my ex again for it. it’s the best. i use it at night with other serums but i notice that it is this product that smooths and hydrates my skin overnight. literally obsessed it makes my redness and acne scars look so much better and heals any new damage on my skin. LOVE


Positive: 
Sentiment: love this moisturizer
Skin: smooths and hydrates my skin overnight, my redness, acne scars look so much better

Negative: 
None
##makes me breakout

A little about my skin:
-combo/oily 
-acne prone

I have a jar of this as a backup for when I run out of my lineup of regular moisturizers- I bought it thinking it would help my dry patches in the winter and then got too lazy to return in. EVERY SINGLE TIME I USE IT, I BREAKOUT. 

My skincare consists of aha/bha 2-3 nights per week and vitamin c the other nights. I typically use the Inky List Peptide moisturizer, IT cosmetics Secret Sauce, or the Glow Recipe watermelon gel moisturizer (dependent on heat/humidity) and never breakout. But as soon as I use this on my face, WHAM! pimple. I’ll give this a 1 because it also doesn’t do much for moisturizing in the winter when my skin needs more hydration and moisture. It’s overpriced and not worth the hype.


Negative: 
Allergy: makes me breakout, his on my face, WHAM! pimple
Skin: combo/oily, acne prone, doesn’t do much for moisturizing
Demographic: winter
Price: overpriced
Sentiment: not worth the hype

Competitor: Inky List Peptide moisturizer,, cosmetics Secret Sauce, Glow Recipe watermelon gel
##Definitely Worth Trying

Love Love Love this Cream . My face gets extremely dry especially when I get out of the shower . My face was always dry and my skin use to peel because it was so dry . I use this cream everyday and it helped my face a lot . I also have sensitive skin and this cream did not irritate my skin . My face no long feels dry and my skin doesn’t peel anymore .


Positive: 
Performance: extremely dry, peel because it was so dry, skin doesn’t peel

My skin gets super dry during the cold months and this moisturizer has been a life saver! The tube is big enough to last me a year!! For that price it’s a win win


Positive: 
Skin: super dry
Packaging: big enough to last me a year
Price: price it’s a win

Negative:

##Pills and Burns

This moisturizer isn’t anything special in my opinion but the cons to it is that it burns like really bad which has never happened to me before and it also pills which is strange. I thought it was my sunscreen or other products but I put it on by itself, and my face started pilling. I usually don’t do reviews but I think some people should know.


Negative: 
Allergy: burns like really bad, pills which is strange

Positive: 
None
##the BEST

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. I've been using this moisturizer since 2009 and it's seriously the best moisturizer I've ever used. I have dry, rosacea prone skin and this is so soothing and moisturizing. It feels pretty heavy going in, but it absorbs wonderfully and doesn't pill with anything. I've applied it over serums, under SPF and makeup, and I've never had an issue. If you have dry skin and redness, use this over Josie Maran argan milk and it will change your life.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Purchase: since 2009
Skin: dry, rosacea prone skin, moisturizing, dry skin, redness
Texture: absorbs wonderfully
Allergy: doesn't pill with anything
##burns!

I’ve used the ultra repair cream for over 6 years and they recently changed their formula and now it BURNS when I put it on. It doesnt even burn when I put my tretinoin on but the second I put this on, it burns!!


Negative: 
Application: changed their formula
Allergy: now it BURNS when I put it on

Positive: 
Competitor: when I put my tretinoin
##Wasn’t for me

I wanted to love it, but I just couldn’t. My skin isn’t extremely dry, nor is it oily in the slightest. CeraVe has been my holy grail for years and I just wanted to switch it up. However, anytime I would use this as moisturizer it would end up pilling off of my skin within 30 minutes. Whether I paired it with a primer and skin tint in order to do my makeup, or if I was just doing my skin care routine, it happened every time. If I had put it on before makeup, within that hour I would be having to get all of the pilled product off of my skin with a napkin. I tried so many different combos, stopped using certain products with it, etc. None worked! The only way it stopped was when I stopped using the moisturizer. The consistency of it is so nice and it makes your skin feel really good, I was just disappointed my skin didn’t love it as much as I wanted to.


Positive: 
Competitor: CeraVe has been my holy grail
Texture: consistency of it is so nice

Negative: 
Skin: isn’t extremely dry, nor is it oily in the slightest
Allergy: would end up pilling
Application: paired it with a primer, skin tint in order to do my makeup
##my holy grail

I have to say, I love FAB products! I’ve tried a lot (more on the dry skin range) and everything has been great. This is my holy grail moisturizer. I would say it’s slightly on the heavy side, but not unusable for normal or combo skin. I have been buying this for years. I typically add squalane and Marula to it. It’s really amazing and calming for my very dry skin. Haven’t had any issues with it. And a decent price for what it is and how much you can get. One of the rare items I have bought ten times.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Brand: I love FAB products
Purchase: buying this for years, I have bought ten times
Application: add squalane, Marula to it
Performance: really amazing and calming

##Healed my Keratosis pilaris

This stuff is incredible!! I’ve suffered from keratosis pilaris my entire life and nothing has helped smooth out my arms like this has! I am amazed. I also use it as my night time cream for my face and I love it. I do not recommend this as a day cream if you wear makeup, tends to pill. If you had KP give this a try!


Negative: 
Allergy: tends to pill

Positive: 
Skin: Healed my Keratosis pilaris
Application: my arms, my night time cream, my face
##First review .. so disappointed

Why oh why oh why did this have to be reformulated to include essential oils? This product is no longer safe for my super sensitive, rosacea prone skin. I’ve been purchasing this product for over five years and now I have an entire tub of it I won’t be able to use because it’s no longer fragrance free. So disappointed. If you have rosacea or very sensitive skin, be cautious using this.


Negative: 
Application: reformulated to include essential oils
Skin: super sensitive, rosacea prone skin

Positive: 
None
##Great Moisturizer and Great for Healing Sunburns

I have pretty fair skin and dry out pretty quickly. This does a very great job moisturizer my skin. I also tend to get pretty sunburns and even after being very diligent in applying moisturizer, I ALWAYS peel. Last weekend, I got a really bad sunburn and used this lotion instead. to my surprise I didn’t peel! I definitely love this product!


Positive: 
Skin: pretty fair skin, eally bad sunburn, my surprise I didn’t peel!

Negative: 
None
##Love it

I'm surprised how much I love this. It's so cost effective and the product works great for me. I have normal skin and it's great for both night time and for day time layered with an spf. I will be reordering for sure.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Price: cost effective
Application: layered with an spf
Purchase: will be reordering
##Irritated my skin :/

I had been wanting to purchase this item for years, so when I did I was excited to try it. The first time I tried it I realized the cream gave my skin and almost burning sensation and my face would turn blotchy. I did however notice that it did leave my skin soft. This product is not for sensitive skin, but I did moisturize my skin.


Negative: 
Allergy: almost burning sensation, my face would turn blotchy
Skin: not for sensitive skin

Positive: 
None
##maybe not the best for sensitive skin…

i don’t understand why fab markets this as a repair cream. it’s a nicely hydrating moisturizer that isn’t thick or greasy and it gets the job done. but the inclusion of eucalyptus oil just ruins the whole moisturizer imo. i’ve been using this for a couple of days, the first time i tried it, it stung a bit around my nose & chin but i ignored it bc i was also exfoliating that night. today, my skin feels very sensitized and my products have started to sting so i’ve decided to stop using it :/ first aid beauty if by any chance you’re reading sephora reviews please remove the eucalyptus oil from this moisturizer it’s defeating the whole purpose of being a repairing cream!!!


Positive: 
None

Negative: 
Performance: markets this as a repair cream, defeating the whole purpose of being a repairing
Ingredients: eucalyptus oil just ruins
Allergy: stung a bit
Purchase: stop using it
##SIMPLY THE BEST

This is a 10/10. I prefer the bottle formulation over the tub. I suffer from severe eczema and dry patches on my eyes and cheeks and this literally healed it in less than 2 days!!! It’s literally a miracle. Absolutely fabulous for dry sensitive skin. I’ve tried it all and this has to be the best.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Packaging: bottle formulation over the tub
Skin: severe eczema, dry patches on my eyes and cheeks, dry sensitive skin
##Best Moisturizer EVER

Literally the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. Helps soothe my acne and moisturizes me without feeling heavy. Perfect for your hands as well. Couldn’t recommend this enough!


Positive: 
Skin: soothe my acne, moisturizes me
Texture: without feeling heavy

Negative: 
None
##Wrong for dry skin

Not the products fault but this was recommended by one of Sephora's "experts" for me.  I told her I had VERY dry skin and my age.  She recommended this product - it's just the wrong product for my skin - it's actually somehow making my skin dryer and feeling parched.  I'll just go back to Oil of Olay at least my skin's not tight with their products.


Negative: 
Motivation: recommended by one of Sephora's
Skin: VERY dry skin
Performance: somehow making my skin dryer, feeling parched

Positive: 
Competitor: Oil of Olay
##luxurious feel

One of the best creams I’ve ever used as far as feel. I put it on my hands after I’ve put on all of my lotions etc. post-shower. I do this because it feels so nice as a top coat. I don’t think it hydrated my skin all that much however, nor does it last for a super long time. I just use it for how incredibly good it feels on my hands. So smooth!


Positive: 
None

Negative: 
Skin: don’t think it hydrated my skin
Performance: nor does it last for a super long time
##No nonsense moisturizer

Been using this as a night time moisturizer, feels great on the skin, very nice ingredient list/formula, doesn’t smell, and doesn’t sweat out like most heavy moisturizers I have tried… and is significantly less expensive than most other brands of this quality, highly recommend! 
The only caveat is that it just isn’t very exciting. It does what I want it to do, which is moisturize & occlude, and the colloidal oatmeal seems to soften & heal blemish marks. But otherwise it’s just a plain moisturizer with no frills.

##smells bad, feels weird.

I'm glad I got this as a sample, because I don't think I can finish this...it smells like vomit and doesn't feel like it cleans my combination skin. I really wanted to give it a chance, slightly holding my breath while rubbing it on my face, and made it through most of the tube (the sample size was fairly decent), and I didn't notice any results, just a weird waxy coating. I would not purchase this. And for real, I can't emphasize how bad it smells.

##My go to daytime moisturizer

This is my go to daily moisturizer. I live in a very dry state. This is very moisturizing and gentle. It is great to use during the day under your make up to get the hydration without looking super greasy. Very great product for the price. No frills just you get what is advertised


Positive: 
Demographic: very dry state

##Careful if you have dry sensitive/eczema prone ski

I have combo/dry sensitive skin with occasional perioral dermatitis. I wanted something thicker than lotion so I tried this. After I wash my face, I use HA serum then this cream. If you don't have inflamed skin/open wounds on your face, this is a great moisturizer but since I have the condition around my mouth, this stings for several seconds. 
I ended up using this everywhere else on my face since I don't have that reaction elsewhere. Another thing is that I didn't find this as moisturizing alone and often find myself layering another layer of cream on top. 
If you have a skintype like mine, I'd suggest just using a cheaper moisturizing cream mixed with a couple drops of non-comedogenic hydrating oil. This is still a good product as it was more moisturizing than my previous lotion. I'd buy again when my eczema is tamed and my skin isn't as dry.


Negative: 
Skin: don't have inflamed skin/open wounds

Positive: 
Application: HA serum, everywhere else on my face
##Skin Savior

this stuff literally saved my skin. I had horrible perioral dermatitis around my nose and this helped clear it up. no irritating fragrance and makes your skin look baby smooth.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: horrible perioral dermatitis
Odor: no irritating fragrance
Texture: skin look baby smooth
##not what I expected

Good consistency. Doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. But my god the pilling is HORRIBLE. You can’t layer this with anything. I hate that I can feel a layer of this sitting on top of my skin and it doesn’t actually moisturize as much as I thought it would given how thick it is. Returning this ASAP.


Positive: 
Skin: sensitive skin

Negative: 
Allergy: pilling is HORRIBLE
Application: an’t layer this with anything
Skin: doesn’t actually moisturize
##Hate this

This is the worst cream I have ever used. It irritates my skin and doesn't provide any moisture even though it's very thick. I'll stick to Kiehls and Clinique.


Negative: 
Allergy: irritates my skin
Skin: doesn't provide any moisture

Positive: 
Brand: Kiehls, Clinique
##Great nighttime moisturizer but pills

Love love love this product as I have super dry skin especially in my T zone. My only negative comment that held me back from giving this product 5 stars is that this product PILLS extremely under any makeup and sunscreen I put on top. This is why I only wear it at night and it works for me.


Positive: 
Skin: super dry skin

Negative: 
Allergy: that this product PILLS
##Quality Face Cream

##MEH

For a long time I remember wanting this moisturizer so bad and when I finally got it on sale for black Friday, I was ecstatic. Unfortunately, it wasn't as moisturizing as I thought it would be. In fact, I didn't like it as a body moisturizer either but I'll continue to use it Simply because I have it. although I know some people who love it and I know that FAB has other amazing products, I'll have to give this one a pass.


Positive: 
Brand: FAB has other amazing products,

Negative: 
Motivation: finally got it on sale for black Friday
Skin: wasn't as moisturizing
Application: didn't like it as a body moisturizer
##Worth it!

I’ve never tried a higher end face cream. I’ve always used Cerave. Wow…this is so worth it. It feels luxurious. My skin feels hydrated. Absolutely no irritation. Will continue to repurchase.


Positive: 
Sentiment: higher end face cream
Competitor: Cerave
Performance: Absolutely no irritation
Purchase: Will continue to repurchase

None
##Burns and pills

I was excited when I found this because of the price for 6oz of product. Unfortunately it doesn’t work well for my skin. It burns when I put it on after my skincare routine and pills when I put on makeup. My other face moisturizers do not do this. It works fine as a moisturizer on my arms and hands so I just use it for that purpose.


Negative: 
Allergy: It burns, pills when I put on

Positive: 
Motivation: excited when I found this because of the price
Packaging: for 6oz of
Application: moisturizer on my arms and hands
##i think they reformulated

i’ve used this before about a year or so ago & i absolutely loved it, but it’s just but this again during the sale & it doesn’t feel the same, it feels so different. it does hydrate the skin which is good, but there’s like a very very small cooling sensation almost.


Positive: 
None

Negative: 
Application: doesn’t feel the same
##A good option

A good moisturizer, maybe a littler bit basic for the price but the amount that you get is pretty good. May be too much for oily skin for all other skin types it should be good.


Positive: 
Packaging: amount that you get is pretty good

Negative: 
Sentiment: bit basic for the price
Skin: too much for oily skin
##Be careful acne prone skin

Bought bc I heard so many good things but made me breakout sooo bad- I haven’t broken out in years.. very hydrating but definitely not for acne prone skin.


Positive: 
None

Negative: 
Skin: careful acne prone ski, definitely not for acne prone skin
Motivation: bc I heard so many good things
##acne prone combo skin - love it

Using this for years (at least 5 years now) and love it. I have acne prone skin that’s oily/dry combination. I use this after washing my face in the morning and at night. It doesn’t feel greasy and I don’t have dry spots anymore. Love it!


Positive: 
Purchase: for years (at least 5
Texture: doesn’t feel greasy
Skin: don’t have dry spots

Negative: 
Skin: acne prone skin, oily/dry combination
##Great hydration and not sticky!

Bought this moisturizer for my boyfriend to start his first simple skincare routine with a toner. He was using cerave moisturizing cream but said he loves this fab moisturizing cream way better because it’s not sticky like the cerave. I also have sensitive skin and when my skin feels dry, I would steal his moisturizer cream and use in replacement of my night cream as it’s more hydrating. Love it! Will continue to purchase!


Positive: 
Demographic: for my boyfriend
Brand: this fab moisturizing cream
Texture: because it’s not sticky
Skin: have sensitive skin, my skin feels dry
Purchase: Will continue to purchase

Negative: 
Competitor: cerave moisturizing cream
##Made face break out ALL OVER

I got this for my face bc my skin is SUPER dry. Unfortunately I cannot use it on my face. Although it IS very moisturizing, it made my entire face break out and I don’t even remember the last time that’s happened. 
   I will however continue to use it the rest of my skin, as it is very moisturizer


Negative: 
Allergy: Made face break out ALL OVER, entire face break out
Skin: SUPER dry

##FAB for sure!

Hands down my favorite moisturizer!  Nothing sinks in as fast!  One star deducted because I received two tubs instead of tubes.

Texture: Nothing sinks in as fast
##Not reliable. Petro fishy mold smell again.

I've been buying the Full size unscented Ultra Repair Cream for a few years and I notice this jar and my 2nd jar is off. Petro chemical fishy mold smell again. Cream doesn't glide on or absorb right it stays on top of my face and hands too. It's almost like there is too much oil in it. I'm moving on to a more reliable less chemical smelling deep moisturizing cream.


Positive: 
None

Negative: 
Odor: Petro fishy mold smell
Texture: Cream doesn't glide on or absorb
Performance: too much oil in it
##Intense Hydration? Where?

I tried really hard to like this, it’s just not hydrating at all my skin feels so dry after using. I use this in the morning before using a hydrating sunscreen that’s about it. Farmacy Halo Honey and Dewy Skin by Tatcha is soooo much better if you have combo skin!


Positive: 
Competitor: Farmacy Halo Honey, Dewy Skin by Tatcha

Negative: 
Skin: not hydrating at all, feels so dry
##love!

Very hydrating! Doesn’t leave your face sticky.   I still love the “water bank” by Tatcha more but it’s sooo expensive but when I’m not able to afford that this is my go to! I also use it on my dry legs as well


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: Very hydrating
Texture: Doesn’t leave your face sticky.
Competitor: Tatcha
Application: dry legs
##My Skin Loves It

I am 26 years old. I have dry skin and experience hormonal acne. I like to think of this as a stress-free moisturizer, meaning that I don’t have to worry that it’s not doing it’s job. It’s creamy, moisturizing, and sets in quickly. I saw a review of someone saying it smelled bad but I can’t smell this product hardly at all. It doesn’t break me out and feels gentle. A little of it goes a long way so it’s more lasting that other moisturizers. I saw someone say to not apply makeup after using this due to piling, but I wait for my moisturizer to dry and then use an oil based primer before my foundation.


Positive: 
Demographic: 26 years old
Skin: dry skin, hormonal acne, moisturizing
Texture: creamy,, sets in quickly
Odor: can’t smell this product
Allergy: doesn’t break me out

##Home and Away Kit NOT AS PICTURED

I bought the Home and Away kit because it showed squeeze tubes, however it arrived with two tubs. Even the travel size is a tub. I would not have purchased if I knew it was a tub instead of squeeze tubes. I much prefer squeeze tubes that do not require you to dig your hand in to get the product. It feels unsanitary and messy.


Negative: 
Motivation: Home and Away Kit NOT AS PICTURED
Packaging: Even the travel size is a tub, prefer squeeze tubes

Positive: 
None
##The reviews are right!

This stuff is magic and worth the hype. I use it as my night cream on my extremely sensitive skin and I wake up to it feeling buttery and soft. The texture is perfect - not too thick and not to thin. I will repurchase again and again!


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Sentiment: stuff is magic, worth the hype
Skin: extremely sensitive skin
Texture: not too thick, not to thin
Purchase: will repurchase again
##misleading packaging

Unsure if this was a mistake on Sephora’s end or not but the product I received was not these two tubes but rather two pots. I love this moisturizer but I wanted to switch over to the tubes instead of the pots since there is less chance of contamination that way. I’ll probably end up scraping it into a travel tube so that I can still use the product but I definitely wish I knew this before purchasing.


Negative: 
Packaging: misleading packaging, ot these two tubes but rather two pots

Positive: 
None
##Gentle and Effective

I have perpetually struggled with acne and I still do at the age of 29. My skin tends to dry out from the acne products I use and it is extremely sensitive. Finding a moisturizer that doesn't break me out horribly has been one heck of a challenge. That is, until I found this product. It absorbs into the skin very quickly without leaving any kind of residue. It doesn't break me out, either. My face is so soft since I've been using this product daily.

##Skin calming agent

Its a great product for dry skin, I recently moved to abroad from india and was struggling to find a best moisturiser for my dry skin was ruined by the cold winter weather of Florida. 
my skin was dry flaky itchy and red. 
I found this product on the Instagram and was curious to try this out went to Sephora and bought this thing. What a magic product it was, it quickly absorbs and leaves skin a dewy glow, I was using this from last two months and it great product.

Purchase: Won’t buy again

Positive: 
Skin: year round dry skin
Allergy: hasn’t made me blotchy red or burn

Negative: 
None
##Not for me

Thick, making my skin clog. Use very lightly. Also pills if you try and put any makeup over top of it, flaking everything off. I only use it midday while working from home if I need a little pick me up. Such a specific use case, I won't repurchase.


Positive: 
None

Negative:

Allergy: Also pills

##Super Hydrating Cream

This cream can be a little thick and heavy in application if you use a lot but I apply it lightly in the summer and heavier in the winter depending on my skin’s needs. Since I have hyper sensitive skin, this cream with colloidal oatmeal formula has reduced redness patches and has helped in healing acne damage. I have used this product for more than two years and it has changed my life. It also has no fragrance and it does not feel or look greasy. I usually apply it at night or when my face needs extra love. I do wear it during the day with a lighter application. My skin can stay hydrated with this cream for up to 48 hours. I’ve experienced significantly less breakouts and I am very happy with my longterm results. I love it!

##Calms down redness!

I have extremely dry skin with a lot of redness from rosacea. After a few days of using this my skin felt much more hydrated and my redness has gone down significantly! I love that it absorbs into my skin and isn't greasy. It's a win for me!

##Will Want to Buy Again and Again

This is a great every-day moisturizer. I've already ordered more than once. It's not too heavy or too thin, easy to apply, absorbs quickly, and does not leave a residue or unpleasant scent. It's a bit pricy, but worth it.


Negative: 
Price: bit pricy

Positive: 
Purchase: Want to Buy Again and Again
Texture: not too heavy or too thin, easy to apply, absorbs quickly
##misleading photo, different packaging

I like this moisturizer a lot but the home and away kit doesn’t come in the containers pictured. Both home and travel size containers are the tubs that you have to put your hand in each time.  I definitely would not have purchased if I knew this was the packaging…… literally bought the home and away kit for the squeeze type packaging since it’s more sanitary


Negative: 
Packaging: misleading photo, different packaging, home and travel size containers are the tubs
Motivation: home and away kit doesn’t come

Positive: 
Packaging: squeeze type
##This is it! My hands have healed!!!!

Eucerin ❌, Vaseline ❌, Mustela ❌, Wedela ❌, Aveeno ❌, Nivea ❌, Aquaphor ❌, Dr Rx ❌, CeraVe ❌, Cetaphil ❌ Absolutely nothing has helped my extreme pain, dryness and itch to go away or be soothed like FAB Ultra Repair Cream. This is magic and it’s exactly what my hands have needed. I actually bought the mango and grapefruit a while back and I didn’t care for it on my face so I left it in my cabinet. I recently decided to give it a try on my hands and it’s just a miracle cream, I bought more last week and my hands are about 80% better, I haven’t felt the burn when I simply wash my hands, my skin isn’t splitting and my hands don’t look old anymore. It can be a bit on the pricier side but it’s so worth it. Please don’t ever discontinue. This works 100%!!!

##Quick Absorbing Moisturizer

I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have been using this for about a week (first time purchase, applying twice a day, morning/after shower) and already I'm getting so many compliments from people saying my face looks so radiant and smooth. It absorbs FAST into the skin and doesn't leave a heavy, greasy feeling on my face.


Positive: 
Sentiment: absolutely love this moisturizer

Negative: 
None
##sad and full of acne

Really sad to say that it made me break like nothing ever has!! I’ve never felt so insecure :(
It took me a while to realize that the burning I was feeling was not good because my face usually burns a lot during the winter because of how dry it is. 20 days into use it the burning never stopped. That’s when I connected the dots to my recent abnormal breakout. 
I give it two stars because my worked wonders on my girlfriend face! She loves it and it is helping her dryness. :)


Negative: 
Allergy: sad and full of acne, made me break like nothing ever has, burning I was feeling
Sentiment: never felt so insecure

Positive: 
None
##Perfect thick moisturizer

Love love love this moisturizer. It is perfect for my skin in the dry, winter climate where I live because it is VERY thick. I usually only use this at night because if I use it everyday, I think it clogs my pores and I notice an increase in blackheads. Only using it at night has resolved that problem.


Positive: 
Texture: Perfect thick moisturizer
Demographic: dry, winter climate

Negative: 
Allergy: clogs my pores, increase in blackheads
##Not working

I'm disappoint that this didn't work for me. I don't feel like my face is moisturized and gives that look of a moisturized face. But the number one problem that I have with this product is that it peels. I can't wear make-up or a lightweight sunscreen without it peel. Thankfully I just very recently bought it and willing be returning it for something else.


Negative: 
Skin: don't feel like my face is moisturized
Allergy: is that it peels
Application: can't wear make-up
Purchase: willing be returning it for something else

Positive: 
None
##Love!

I would consider myself to have sensitive, combo skin, with minimal redness through my cheeks, especially in the winter. I am always a little hesitant to try new products, as I'm prone to break out. I LOVE this cream! It is super hydrating, without being heavy and oily. I love wearing this under makeup during the day, but I have also enjoyed wearing at night. I have been using this for over a month now and have not broken out once (fingers crossed)- I even got my mom hooked on it while we were on vacation and her moisturizer just wasn't doing it for her.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: sensitive, combo skin, super hydrating
Texture: without being heavy and oily
Application: love wearing this under makeup
Allergy: have not broken out once (
Demographic: got my mom hooked on it
##Hydrated skin is happy skin!

I have been using the First Aid Beauty Ultra repair cream intense hydration for about 2 months now. I originally bought the small ounce bottle and fell in love with the product and I immediately bought the 6 ounce. 

- It hydrates
- No grease feeling
- Left my skin looking smooth

All I could say if you do have oily skin, the hydration may be a bit too much, but for my combo skin/sensitive I felt like it was fine. 

I would definitely repurchase this product (:

Motivation: originally bought the small ounce bottle
Skin: It hydrates, combo skin/sensitive

Overhyped, it’s just not that good. I don’t think it moisturizes my skin well and it’s too thick for no reason (same). There’s definitely better out there!

##Best Hand + Body Cream!

LOVE this as a hand and body cream!! Rich, creamy and wonderfully hydrating. I have sensitive skin that turns red and can break out with certain ingredients, but I’ve had no reactions to this FAB cream. Been using this for years! I prefer the tube to the tub as it’s more sanitary. Highly recommend!

##Greasy/oily

I got this as a sample. 1st impressions were it was instantly moisturizing and didn't have to wait for it to "soak in" my skin. Then I noticed the palms of my hands were very greasy and oily. I want to feel moisturized, not oily. I felt like I wanted to wash the oil off my hands but it'd defeat the whole purpose.


Negative: 
Texture: Greasy/oily, I wanted to wash the oil off

##Great for old skin working outside.

I'm a 63 year old male that works outside, my hands and arms take a beating in under the Mississippi sun.  The back of my hands daily look like lizard skin, arms to a lessor extent wearing long sleeve shirts with a high SPF rating.  

Yesterday I didn't have time to apply the cream and the tops of my hands look great.  The tube of Jurgens has hit the trash.The product might be for everyone, but I'm sold and will continue to use it.

my favorite moisturizer! for a while i had really painful dry patches and acne and it helped with both. I also like how it doesn’t make me too shiny in the morning but feels hydrating.


Positive: 
Performance: doesn’t make me too shiny
Skin: but feels hydrating

Negative: 
None
##not moisturizing

I bought this after seeing how popular it was and reading the reviews but it doesn’t work for me :( for some reason it doesn’t really moisturize my skin, or maybe it absorbs really quickly but like 10 minutes after applying, it feels like nothing really happened so I’ll apply it twice sometimes. It’s super lightweight and for reference I have normal skin that’s only slightly dry in the winter. Also there’s a weird minty smell.


Positive: 
Motivation: after seeing how popular it was, reading the reviews

Negative: 
Skin: oesn’t really moisturize my skin
Odor: weird minty smell
##Very good for dry skin.

This cream has done wonders for my dry skin. My only complaint would be that the smell leaves something to be desired.

##New formula? Smells and applies like sunscreen

I used to love this cream. It was perfect for my face and body. No scent, easy to apply and quick to absorb. It looks like they changed their formula. Now it smells like sunscreen and it takes rubbing to get it to absorb. I won’t be using this again.


Positive: 
None

Negative: 
Application: New formula? Smells and applies like sunscreen, used to love this cream

Texture: doesn't make me oily

Negative: 
Price: don't love the pric

Texture: also not too heavy, really soothing
Sentiment: great basic no frills face cream
Skin: eally does help with dryness
##Crime against my face

This broke me out SO BADDDD. I rarely break out, the only time i get pimples are around my period on my chin. THIS MADE ME GET WHITE HEADS ALL OVER MY FACE. Nose, cheeks, forehead, chin, literally i have never had acne like this in my life. I returned and got the keihls one instead, hopefully thats better


Positive:

Allergy: broke me out SO BADDDD, GET WHITE HEADS ALL OVER MY FACE

##Wrecked my skin!

I rarely have non-hormonal breakouts (all of which are on my chin typically), and I’ve never reacted to a product before. I was hoping this would help how dry my skin gets in winter, but it made me breakout all over my face: my chin, forehead, cheeks, jaw. As soon as I switched back to the moisturizer I was using before, I stopped breaking out. Would NOT recommend as a facial moisturizer


Negative: 
Performance: Wrecked my skin!
Skin: would help how dry my skin gets in winter, but
Allergy: made me breakout all over my face
Sentiment: Would NOT recommend

##Pills and feels weird on skin, disappointing

I was so excited to buy this because of all the great reviews I've seen for it, and I was pretty disappointed after a week a using it. My biggest complaint is how it pills. It's almost like it's not being absorbed into the skin and sits like a film that will ball up if you touch your face after applying. I tried different ways of applying (using less, using more, patting, rubbing, only rubbing it in for a certain amount of time, etc) and it did it every time. I honestly wouldn't mind it too much if it didn't mess up my makeup application- everything clings to the moisturizer now and looks grainy. My skin does feel softer after using consistently, but like I said earlier, it fills almost filmy. Plus, I don't think it lives up to the "intense hydration" name. I looked at recent reviews after I started seeing problems and apparently they changed their formula. My acne has cleared up with this though, and some of my redness has faded, so that's a nice quality of it. Will be returning though, the pilling and weird film feeling isn't worth the price in my opinion.

Allergy: Pills, biggest complaint is how it pills

##burns and hurts

I was so excited to try this and literally the second I put it on my skin started burning and got red. I thought maybe my skin just needed to adjust to it so I left it on, it burned for hours. I really wanted to love this but after admitting defeat I scrubbed it off. Unfortunately my face still hurts hours after washing it off and I am praying I don't break out.  (Obvi I have learned now to wipe it off immediately)

##BEST MOISTURIZER EVER!!!

I live in AZ where the weather is extremely dry. This is the only moisturizer I trust! It wears beautifully underneath makeup and works incredibly on its own. It is worth every single penny! Every few years, the value size will go on sale for $15 and I stock up! Literally, I bought 4 value size bottles last time it went on sale. I love this stuff and I can’t say enough good things about it.

None

Sentiment: BEST MOISTURIZER EVER
Demographic: live in AZ

##ok

This is great but I didn’t like the weird smell it has. But it was super hydrating and effective.


Positive: 
Odor: didn’t like the weird smell
Skin: super hydrating

Negative: 
None
##Major breakouts

So bummed that I didn’t like this moisturizer because the tub is huge and it seems like a good value. But unfortunately there is an ingredient in this product that my face HATES. After about a week of using, I broke out badly which is very unlike my skin. I have clear skin 95% of the time, only get an occasional spot here and there. I have quite dry skin and not sensitive to products typically. I do like the formula and how it absorbs into the skin quickly. But I will be going back to my Clinique moisturizer.


Positive: 
Packaging: tub is huge and it seems like a good value
Competitor: going back to my Clinique moisturizer

Negative: 
Allergy: broke out badly
Skin: quite dry skin
##just ok, nothing special

Got this with points based on the reviews to try before purchasing a full size. It was just ok, the hype was so huge that i expected it to be a game changer. At first it does feel very hydrating and soft but it dries up so quickly that my morning it the area i apply it to is so dry that it feels like i washed my hands and didnt apply lotion. Lots of other products out there that do what this claims


Negative: 
Sentiment: hype was so huge
Skin: dries up so quickly

Positive: 
Motivation: based on the reviews to try
##Unbelievably Good

WOW! I live in a super dry area and I have been struggling to find a decent face moisturizer. Well this has easily become my holy grail moisturizer!!! Thick and smooth without being sticky/oily/chunky on the skin. I will never buy a different moisturizer again.


Positive: 
Demographic: super dry area
Sentiment: has easily become my holy grail
Skin: Thick and smooth
Purchase: will never buy a different moisturizer again

Negative: 
Texture: without being sticky/oily/chunky
##doesn't live up to the hype (at all)

Like some other reviewers, I'm extremely confused about the hype surrounding this product. It says "intense hydration" and leaves my face with a dry cast all over. I can't imagine it being hydrating unless it were combined with a humectant product. The tub is huge and it's a terrible moisturizer, so I am definitely disappointed.


Negative: 
Sentiment: doesn't live up to the hype (at all)
Skin: with a dry cast all over

Positive: 
None
##If you have rosacea, this is the product for you.

I love this product. It does exactly what it says and it’s great for dry, sensitive skin. It also helps a lot with rosacea.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: rosacea, this is the product for you, dry, sensitive skin, helps a lot with rosacea
##not for combination skin

I’ve received this product as a free sample and have been using it for two days. I consider my skin a combination skin and I don’t think that was the best choice for me. My skin feels tacky right after applying the product, as if it didn’t absorb it, and during the morning I woke up with a very oily face. I expected more since it’s a very hyped product on social media.


Negative: 
Skin: not for combination skin
Texture: feels tacky right after applying, didn’t absorb it, with a very oily face

Positive: 
Motivation: received this product as a free sample, very hyped product on social media
##Love!!!!

Love this holy grail!!! It leaves the skin so soft and not oily. It’s very hydrating. The only cream that has truly worked on my skin.


Positive: 
Sentiment: Love this holy grail
Texture: skin so soft, not oily.
Skin: t’s very hydrating

Negative: 
None
##Not enough for parched skin

I give this 3/5 stars.  I found it absorbs really quickly unless you just coat your face in it at night,   almost like you would a mask.  It broke me out so now I just use it on my hands.  I do like the cooling lightweight texture, but for parched skin like mine, it just did not do the trick.


Positive: 
Texture: absorbs really quickly, cooling lightweight texture

Negative: 
Skin: Not enough for parched skin
Allergy: It broke me out
##Dissatisfied

I really did not like this product. I’m confused by all of the hype surrounding it. It pills horribly, didn’t moisturize my dry skin effectively, and felt cheap overall. Absolutely not worth it, in my opinion, for the price point. I’ve had better experiences with <$15 moisturizers.


Negative: 
Performance: Dissatisfied
Allergy: pills horribly
Skin: didn’t moisturize, my dry skin effectively,
Sentiment: felt cheap overall
Price: not worth it, in my opinion, for the price point

Positive: 
None
##Love it

##Not hydrating enough in the winter months

I love this cream before bed in the summer months, but it was not moisturizing enough for me during the winter.


Negative: 
Skin: hydrating enough in the winter months

Positive: 
None
##Best Moisturizer Ever

I have dry, flaky skin. This moisturizer has been my go-to for years. I’ve tried fancier moisturizers to try to ‘upgrade,’ but keep coming back to this one. It even got me through my adjustment to retinol with minimal flaking.


Positive: 
Skin: dry, flaky skin
Purchase: has been my go-to for years
Application: my adjustment to retinol with minimal flaking

Negative: 
None
##Its okay

The product is just okay. I have dry skin and I thought this would be great but it didn't do much. For me that moisturizer should get absorbed and this just didn't do it for me.


Negative: 
Sentiment: product is just okay
Skin: dry skin

Positive: 
None
##10/10 recommend!

I love this product! I have combo/oily acne-prone skin so I was a littler nervous since this is a thicker moisturizer. During the winter, my skin gets extremely flakey and dry all while still oily at times and I use this product overnight and my skin feels amazing the next morning! I definitely recommend this product and look forward to trying it when my skin is less dry.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: combo/oily, acne-prone skin
##So far so good!

It helps my combo, sensitive skin. Mostly it’s been on the dry side. It really does what it says with hydration! It’s not too thick and heavy it feels light on the skin! I don’t feel like it clogs my pores either.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: combo, sensitive skin
Texture: not too thick and heavy
Performance: don’t feel like it clogs my pores either.
##Great multi tasker!

I've used their oil control lotion for years. My skin has always been on the oily side, but this winter I started getting dry patches on my face. This stuff really helped. It's a great product because you can use it all over your body. I was worried using it on my face as I have oily skin, but this left no residue, absorbed quickly and didn't make me break out. It's been great on my hands too! Best thing is how quickly it absorbs any where you use it. Great product to have in drawer for the dry winter months.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Sentiment: Great multi tasker
Skin: getting dry patches on my face
Application: all over your body, great on my hands
Texture: this left no residue,, absorbed quickly
Allergy: didn't make me break out

##Minty eucalyptus

Has eucalyptus?? WHY :( which is not great for sensitive dry skin. If it did not have this i gross t it would be amazing. As soon as I put it on it burners with that mint feeling. So sad.


Negative: 
Odor: Minty eucalyptus
Ingredients: Has eucalyptus??
Skin: sensitive dry skin

Positive: 
None
##Good for the price. Has silicones.

Used this for a couple years. Is a great moisturizer and very nourishing. Its also a great price and has ingredients good for the skin. However it has dimethicone which I try to avoid. Moisturizers without dimethicone or silicones are hard to find, so I used this when I could not afford or get a better one without silicones. I really suggest that First Aid Beauty make a version of this without silicones!!


Positive: 
Price: Good for the price
Purchase: this for a couple years

Negative: 
Ingredients: However it has dimethicone, make a version of this without silicones
Brand: suggest that First Aid Beauty
##Healed my irritated, cracked skin on face & hands

I bought this product when my undereye area was freaking out and really sensitive to my usual skincare products. I also used it on my hands when winter set in and I had issues with cracked, irritated skin underneath my wedding ring. This cream was really calming and made both problems go away. Couldn't ask for more! It's now my go-to moisturizer.


Positive: 
Application: my undereye area, used it on my hands
Skin: cracked, irritated skin underneath
Sentiment: go-to moisturizer.

Negative: 
None
##Just buy it!

This stuff is amazing. I have very dry sensitive skin and this works so well. The only time I am dry and flaky is after skiing multiple days in a row, and really that is just hard on the skin in general. I use this morning and night in the winter and then just nights in the summer. I highly recommend this.


Positive: 
Skin: very dry sensitive skin, flaky is
Demographic: skiing multiple days in a row

Negative: 
None
##My fav

This is my absolute favorite moisturizer. Definitely worth the purchase.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Purchase: worth the purchase.
##Hydration without the greasiness

Love this as a winter moisturizer for my normal to oily skin.  So many great ingredients that nourish the skin and provide relief from any irritation caused by retinoid or acid usage.  A little goes a long way! It's a yummy, thick and creamy texture, but sinks in well and hydrates without leaving a film on the skin or feeling heavy.  I try and steer clear of anything with fragrance or essential oils, as it can often break me out, but the tiny bit of eucalyptus oil is no issue for me.  It's one of the few moisturizers (fragranced or non-fragranced) that doesn't break me out, so it's a staple in my routine!


Positive: 
Texture: without the greasiness, thick and creamy texture, sinks in well, without leaving a film
Skin: normal to oily skin, rritation caused by retinoid or acid usage
Ingredients: great ingredients that nourish the skin, tiny bit of eucalyptus oil is no issue for me

Negative: 
None
##Won’t Be Repurchasing

This product says Intense Hydration, but lacks in terms of that. I expected so much more. It also pills which is unfortunate. I ended up tossing it.


Positive: 
None

Negative: 
Purchase: Won’t Be Repurchasing
Performance: Intense Hydration, but lacks
Allergy: also pills which is unfortunate
##Real Moisture

This product is great on my skin. I’ve been using it on my face and it has a nice cooling affect during application. It’s the only product that has really made my dry skin feel moisturized, especially during the winter months. My skin is sensitive and I haven’t noticed any breakouts since using this product.


Positive: 
Texture: nice cooling affect
Skin: my dry skin
Demographic: winter months

Negative: 
None
##Repaired my skin

My leg has been damaged for years from how water growing up and it has left my skin tight, dry and really itchy. I’ve tried lotion after lotion and oils after oils, and nothing could have revered the damages UNTIL I tried this product. I’ve only used it a few times I I can feel and see major differences. I bought it originally for my boyfriend’s drink skin and wanted to test it out for myself. It works wonder on the face as well, even for my oily skin type. I’m so happy I bought an extra bottle during the sale! I probably would have paid the full price as well


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: skin tight, dry and really itchy, oily skin type
Performance: I can feel and see major differences
Motivation: extra bottle during the sale
##REASON BEHIND BREAKOUTS

I have been using it for over 2 months. 
I had almost perfect skin before using this set, although i felt good while using these products, it sadly ruined my skin and I've experienced the worst breakouts in my life. I have sensetive combination skin and this drastically changed my skin to the worse. Just wish I had realized sooner that this is the reason behind my breakouts so I couldve stopped using the cleanser/moisturizer earlier and maybe could've 'saved my skin'


Negative: 
Performance: sadly ruined my skin
Allergy: worst breakouts in my life, this is the reason behind my breakouts
Skin: sensetive combination skin

Positive: 
None
##Helped with my sensitive skin

This cream is amazing for sensitive skin! I recently developed adult hormonal acne out of nowhere and have tried a million things. Once I did my research and better understood how to care for my skin barrier, I began to try clean products with good ingredients. This has improved my skin so much - love it!!


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: amazing for sensitive skin!, hormonal acne out of nowhere
##Wow

I have dry skin. But THIS SAVED ME. I’ve tried other moisturizers and they clogged my pores, but this does the trick of a heavy moisturizer while being light weight. Worth the price because it will last for a while. I wake up with baby skin every time.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: dry skin
Texture: clogged my pores, but this does the trick
Price: Worth the price
##Bomb!!!!

I’ve tried a lot of moisturizers but this one will forever be my go to.!! This keeps my skin soooo moisturized. When i put it on at night and wake up, its like i just did my skincare rouitine!!


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Sentiment: this one will forever be my go to
Skin: skin soooo moisturized
##Booooooooo

My skin gets really dry in the winter so I gave this a try, but with every use it gave me more acne. I stopped for a week and my skin was clearing up. Gave it another try for a few days and the bumps came right back. It is very moisturizing but also somehow makes my skin look dull.


Negative: 
Demographic: winter
Skin: gave me more acne.
Texture: makes my skin look dull

Positive: 
None
##changed Formula

I don’t normally write reviews but this one and to come up. I have had sensitive skin for so long and have used this for many years! The last two jars have left my skin, more dry, flaky, burns. The consistency also is not as thick. I’ll be shopping for a new moisturizer. I’m sooo sad. This has been my go to.


Positive: 
None

Negative: 
Application: changed Formula
Skin: sensitive skin, eft my skin, more dry, flaky, burns
##My True Love

I have very dry flakey skin and when if I do ever get acne, it has left horrible marks. This cream is great at keeping my face silky smooth and hydrated until I reapply again at night. I can’t live without it, and the gentle ingredients are a plus. Love love love!


Positive: 
Skin: dry flakey skin
Performance: face silky smooth

Negative: 
None
##Love this moisturizer!

This is my standard go to moisturizer. I have been using it for a year now. It can be a little heavy to wear under makeup but I use it every night. It feels great on the skin and leaves my face feeling soft and extra moisturized.


Positive: 
Purchase: using it for a year now
Performance: my face feeling soft
Skin: extra moisturized

Negative: 
Application: be a little heavy to wear under makeup
##SAVED MY SKIN

I have oily skin pretty consistently throughout the entire year. However, around my nose and where my smile lines are, I have always had red, sensitive and irritated skin. THIS product is the only thing I’ve tried that has significantly improved, almost completely gotten rid, of the irritation on my skin. 

The reason I’m giving it 4 stars it because it does break me out. Unfortunately I cannot use this on my entire face. I limit this exclusively to where I’m dry, red and irritated.


Negative: 
Allergy: does break me out.

Positive: 
Application: around my nose, where my smile lines ar
Skin: where I’m dry, red and irritated
##Pleasant all-around lotion

For the price, this is a great purchase. It works well on body as well as face. It has a very slight medicinal smell, but it isn't unpleasant. It dries quickly and doesn't feel greasy.


Negative: 
Texture: For the price, this is a great purchase.
Odor: very slight medicinal smell

Positive: 
Texture: doesn't feel greasy
##best moisturizer

Sooo good and I love the 8 oz for $15 sale every Black Friday!

##underwhelming :(

I really wanted to love this because of it’s a staple in the skin care routine of many people but i didn’t like this cream. i bought this as part of the holiday set and glad i got a good deal on it because otherwise i would be even more disappointed. firstly, i have no idea why it stings every time i rub it in. next, it doesn’t do a good job at moisturizing my skin. all in all, i will be finishing the tub on my body, but don’t think i’ll be purchasing it again.


Positive: 
None

Negative: 
Motivation: holiday set and glad i got a good deal
Allergy: a why it stings every time i rub

Purchase: don’t think i’ll be purchasing it again
##FORMULA CHANGE NOT GOOD

can’t believe it I’ve been using this moisturizer for years on my very dry skin and it changed my life.. I just bought a new jar during the VIB sale and my skin instantly broke out and it took 2 weeks to clear. I read the reviewed and saw so many people explaining that the ingredient change broke out their skin and it’s really true. Now this is going to be a very expensive body moisturizer I will not put this on my face again… and need to find a new moisturizer


Negative: 
Application: FORMULA CHANGE NOT GOOD
Skin: very dry skin
Motivation: bought a new jar during the VIB sale
Allergy: skin instantly broke out

Positive: 
None
##What formula change?

This product is my sensitive skin’s holy grail. Any time I’m breaking out in hives or am feeling ultra dry and itchy, I slather this stuff on my face and it instantly feels so much better. Not sure why there are so many negative reviews about the addition of eucalyptus oil? It’s been in the product for years. The formula hasn’t changed. I use it morning and night—no breakouts or sensitivity!


Positive: 
Skin: sensitive skin’s, feeling ultra dry and itchy

Negative: 
None
##Favorite moisturizer!

I love this moisturizer. I’ve tried what feels like hundreds and this cream makes my skin feel amazing. Great price point, too!


Positive: 
Price: Great price point

Negative: 
None
##usable but not the best

I read the reviews before purchasing it, so I had high hopes for this product. I have combination skin on my face and drier skin on the rest of the body, especially in the winter. I didn’t find this cream hydrating enough to be used as a body lotion, so I tried to use it solely for my face, however it didn’t spread easily on my face. It only worked when I mixed it with my facial serum before applying it on my face. I like that it is fragrance free, which is very important to me in choosing skincare products, however I wish it was more hydration like its name suggests.


Positive: 
Odor: ike that it is fragrance free

Negative: 
Motivation: read the reviews before purchasing it
Skin: combination skin, didn’t find this cream hydrating enough
Demographic: especially in the winter
##Love it!

Best cream I have ever used! It stands true to its description!


Positive: 
Sentiment: Best cream I have ever used!

Negative: 
None
##pilling

This brand is one of my favorite as it has clean ingredients, but this cream pills on my skin. I had to have others try and they also experienced the pilling.  It is such an unfortunate that both Repair Cream and Night Cream pills extensively. Hope it gets resolved soon.


Negative: 
Allergy: pilling, pills on my skin

Positive: 
Brand: This brand is one of my favorite
##The best!

This cream saved my skin. I'll never use anything else.. I had red dry skin with acne (tricky combination skin to treat) and it has all improved because of this cream. it leaves my skin hydrated, ultra soft and doesn't leave any sticky/greasy residue. I've used it daily or over 2 months and love it! I even use it on my hands in the winter and it is awesome.. can't recommend it enough!


Positive: 
Sentiment: This cream saved my skin.
Skin: dry skin, with acne, skin hydrated
Texture: doesn't leave any sticky/greasy residue

Negative: 
None
##formula change

This has been my ALL TIME FAVORITE moisturizer for years and years. Ive recommended this to multiple friends and they all fell in love with it too, especially those on accutane because it’s such a simple hydrating formula. HOWEVER they recently changed the formula and it isn’t the same. It’s not as thick and makes my face oily after just an hour, which I never had an issue with in the past. Why change a formula thats been a cult favorite forever? Very displeased, why fix something that’s not broken? I won’t be repurchasing unless they change it back to the original formula.


Negative: 
Application: Why change a formula thats been a cult favorite forever? V, why fix something that’s not broken? I, won’t be repurchasing unless they change it back

##Saving grace for dry sensitive acne skin

Everyone's acne and skin in general is very different and reacts differently to every product, but this moisturizer has been an absolute game changer for my extremely sensitive, dry, acne prone skin! I have tried basically every moisturizer out there and every single one has broke me out. This one did not break me out at all and is so soothing and hydrating to my sensitive skin and leaves it so soft. I read some other reviews about the reformulation of this product and the addition of eucalyptus oil which irritates some sensitive skin, and I will say it's definitely in there and does smell like it could irritate severely sensitive skin. Mine did totally fine but I do see how it could irritate some skin. Overall though, I highly HIGHLY recommend giving this a try for dry, acne prone skin! It has changed everything for me and is helping my skin get to a much more comfortable and healing state. A super good price too for how big of a container it is! A little goes a long way.


Positive: 
Skin: sensitive, dry, acne prone skin, hydrating to my sensitive skin
Allergy: This one did not break me
Sentiment: It has changed everything for me
Price: super good price too for how big of a container it is!

Negative: 
Odor: does smell like it could irritate
##best moisturizer!!

I love this product! It makes my skin so soft. My whole family uses this. I like this more than the tube!


Positive: 
Performance: my skin so soft
Packaging: more than the tube

Negative: 
None
##Travel size is an incredible hand cream

I have oily skin so I would only use this sparingly when my nose was raw when I was sick. I always liked it but never used it that much. Recently I tried it as a hand cream when my hands were especially chapped, cracked, and painful. In 2 days it fully healed them. This stuff is gold!!


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: oily skin, especially chapped, cracked, and painful
##Always keep it in stock

This really does help with dry skin. I try other lotions and always come back to this one. Thicker cream. Not really a smell to it. Recommend putting it on while your skin is still kind of damp from your shower.


Positive: 
Skin: with dry skin
Texture: Thicker cream
Odor: Not really a smell to it.

Negative: 
None
##Love this product but Sephora lost my package

Love this product in the value size but Sephora lost my package and now it's unavailable everywhere. HOW?! Obviously it's popular.... facepalm.


Negative:

Packaging: in the value size
##Baby soft skin within a week!

LOVE IT!!! 
Bought at 50% off this Black Friday weekend. Using this for my face to replace CeraVe Moisturizing Cream in the tub (it was too thick), my routine otherwise stayed same.

Witch Hazel, TO Niacinamide, TO Hyaluronic, and THIS


Negative:

Positive: 
Performance: Baby soft skin within a week!
Motivation: Bought at 50% off this Black Friday weekend
##Highly recommended, Worth the money

I have ordered this face cream again and again. Not only me, my husband also uses it. We love this product! It makes the skin clearer than before. We have seen reduced acne and reduction in spots. Highly recommended.

##Game changer for sensitive skin

This stuff is the greatest!! Anytime I’m having an allergic reaction and my eyes get red and blotchy, this is the only product I can use. It’s so gentle and helps with the dryness. I cannot recommend this product enough if you have sensitive skin. It doesn’t make me breakout either.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Sentiment: This stuff is the greatest!!
Skin: helps with the dryness, sensitive skin
Allergy: doesn’t make me breakout either
##LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!

I can’t say enough good things about this cream! I have had eczema my entire life and I have tried a lot of prescription and otc creams/lotions, but nothing compares to this. It works wonders for my skin and helps during the colder months when my skin needs a little extra help. It is a light weight cream and doesn’t leave a greasy or sticky residue. I would highly recommend, 10 out of 10.


Positive: 
Sentiment: can’t say enough good things about this cream!

##love even for oily skin

I have combo/oily dehydrated skin and I'm allergic to eucalyptus (last ingredient on the list). I'm surprised that I don't have any itchiness from the eucalyptus and my skin LOVES this formula. It takes a moment for it to sink in but I'm left with soft and refreshed skin. I think this is one of my favorite moisturizers. I only received the sample size with my points but I plan to get the big size once I'm out!!


Negative: 
None

Positive:

##not a good end result

feels great when applied, but every single time I’ve used it i breakout and I’m not particularly acne prone. sadness, same thing happens when applied to body & face


Negative: 
Allergy: every single time I’ve used it i breakout

Positive: 
None
##Good, not great.

This was my first time using this product and overall, it is a nice moisturizer. I was looking for a daytime moisturizer that would help my skin during the cold and dry fall/winter months. I was hoping for a thicker texture with more intense hydration, but this does a nice job and is buildable. You only need a bit for standard coverage, which will make this product last for awhile. I’ve been using it daily for a month and haven’t even gotten 1/3 of the way through it. 
Overall, I’m happy with my purchase. There isn’t anything incredible about this product, but there isn’t anything bad about it either. I think I’ll try another moisturizer before I reorder this one.


Positive: 
Demographic: fall/winter months
Texture: thicker texture
Packaging: daily for a month and haven’t even gotten 1/3 of the way

##Calming and soothing cream to pair with retinol

This product works amazing, its become my go to moisturizer after trying all high end & most expensive brands. When some one is suffering from acne and using Doctor prescribed retinols or Adapalene you will be undergoing retinization, and  your skin definitely needs this calming moisturizer. Skin easily absorbs this cream and you never feel like its on your skin and makes you skin look plump and healthy .All my skin irritation has stopped after pairing this along with my Differin Adaplene gel and my acne is all gone , and now I am using this cream with glow recipe Guava Vitamin C & I am all excited to see my dark after acne spots getting lighter. Thank you for the Sephora beauty advisor for recommending me this product. This time it worked for me.

##Buyer Beware - Formula Change

Why fix something that isn’t broken? This has been a cult product for more than a decade. It was made for people with skin conditions, dry and sensitive skin. But now the formula has changed in 2021. Eucalyptus oil has been added to the formula among other negative changes. I can no longer use this cream and other products from the brand. It stings and burns very badly. This has been a concern that has been brought up online and many persons are displeased. The formula is still amazing, it spreads like no other. This will probably work for those that don’t have skin conditions, extreme dryness and sensitive skin. I will no longer be able to use it. Please read the ingredients list before purchasing and patch test before properly using it.


Negative: 
Application: Buyer Beware - Formula Change
Ingredients: Eucalyptus oil has been added
Allergy: It stings and burns very badly

Positive: 
Texture: spreads like no other
##the best!

Holy grail moisturizer! Formula is whipped and lightweight, never greasy. Absolutely love that it’s clean, too!


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Sentiment: Holy grail moisturizer!
Texture: Formula is whipped and lightweight,
##WINTER TIME MUST HAVE!!

It has finally become cold and dry where I live, so I bought this as a moisturizer and OML am I glad!! It is truly amazing and my skin feels so hydrated after. A little goes a long way as well, which is also nice.

I would like to note that when I put it on, it has a slight tingling feeling. This didn’t alarm me because I have reactive skin. Even with the tingling, my face never got red or irritated.


Negative: 
Allergy: slight tingling feeling.

Positive: 
Skin: skin feels so hydrated
Allergy: never got red or irritated
##great for sensitive skin!!

I’ve had moderate to severe eczema on my face for the past couple years and I have to say this face cream is the first thicker cream that doesn’t burn when I apply it. I’ve also noticed a difference in keeping my skin moist, as with my eczema it dries out very quickly.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: great for sensitive skin, moderate to severe eczema

##changed my skin

My skin was always red and I had a lot of white heads and I couldn’t get rid of it - I started using panoxyl face wash (leave it on for at least a minute) and this moisturizer and I swear my skin completely changed

Skin: skin was always red, lot of white heads

##perfect face cream for the winter months

I have sensitive combination skin and am closer to 50 than 40. I was looking for something to wear as a day cream in the winter months when my skin tends to be dry. I’ve been using this for a week in the mornings and absolutely love it. It’s thick and rich and has a luxurious feel, but doesn’t feel at all greasy.  Extra points for not causing my skin to break out.


Positive: 
Demographic: winter months, am closer to 50 than 40
Skin: sensitive combination skin
Texture: thick and rich, doesn’t feel at all greasy
Allergy: not causing my skin to break out

##bring back the old formula!

This used to be my go to nighttime moisturizer until they changed the formula and added eucalyptus oil now it burns and irritates my sensitive skin. Eucalyptus is a no no for people like myself with rosacea. Bring back the old formula please!


Negative: 
Application: bring back the old formula!
Ingredients: added eucalyptus oil now
Allergy: burns and irritates my sensitive skin

Positive: 
None
##changed my skin

I have eczema so my skin on it’s worse days peels and is very patchy & flaky and since I’ve incorporated this into my routine I haven’t had a bad skin day like that since, it doesn’t have a dewy look but its deeply hydrating prefect to use before bed or applying makes it comes with SO much product which it amazing


Positive: 
Skin: eczema so my skin, deeply hydrating prefect
Performance: doesn’t have a dewy look

Negative: 
None
##Drying, doesn't absorb well

I wanted to love the Ultra Repair Cream because of the hype, but it just didn't work for me. I found it to be super drying, almost like it left a cast on my skin. I'd have to use a facial oil underneath it each time I put it on, and it gave me dry patches around my nose, eyebrows, and hairline. It's gentle, which is great, and didn't irritate my acne-prone skin, but the cons outweigh the pros here in my opinion. Wasn't worth the price.


Negative: 
Sentiment: Ultra Repair Cream because of the hype,
Skin: found it to be super drying
Texture: left a cast on my skin
Allergy: dry patches around my nose
Price: Wasn't worth the price

Positive: 
None
##the new reformulation broke me out

I used to use this alot and then stopped to try other products. I went back to this moisturizer because it was effective and affordable but with the reformulated one I started noticing every time I used it I would get more and more pimples appearing on my face. it's still really moisturizing but whatever is in it is not making the skin on my face happy so this will now be foot cream.


Positive: 
Skin: still really moisturizing

Negative: 
Application: new reformulation broke me out
Allergy: more pimples appearing on my face
##favorite moisturizer, even for oilier skin!!!

i have purchased so many of these, holy grail moisturizer! originally bought it because i had super dry skin about 3 years ago and it transformed my skin- only 6 months later i found my skin to be more combination/normal and no dry spots like i had before. now my skin is more on the combination/oily side but i still use this, although not applying as heavily, nightly because it’s the only one that i’ve tried that works as well as this one (and believe me, i’ve tried a lot of them)

(i am a sephora employee, but purchased myself)


Positive: 
Skin: super dry skin, dry spots like i had before

Negative: 
None
##The best night cream I’ve used

The best night cream I’ve ever used. I used to have a million skincare steps to try and manage acne prone skin, which became dry from all the treatments etc. This cream is amazing. I mix it with an oil from Biossance and it’s just the best thing for my night time routine. Highly recommend!


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: acne prone skin,
Application: mix it with an oil from Biossance
##At least worth a shot

This is a fairly decent moisturizer. It’s certainly not perfect in my book, but it has some really great qualities. First, I have come to develop mild eczema on my eyelids. Using a small amount around my eyelids has calmed some of the itching and cracking skin. Another redeeming quality is it’s longevity. I live in an aird climate and it’s very difficult to get moisturizer to stick around. This keeps my face soft and mostly hydrated throughout the day. It does a far better job than others I’ve tried (looking at you Tatcha and Drunk Elephant). Third, this is a great price for the quality of product. Especially with the value sets. 

I’m giving this four stars because this product seems to leave a (waxy-like? or silicone-like?) film over my face. I’m not sure how to describe it, but it feels like a residue of sorts. The initial texture is quite dreamy though. Also, I’m not a fan of the smell. Eucalyptus is okay, but it tends to smell kind of stale or perhaps  mildewy. Again, that might not be the correct word. 

Overall this is a great product for the price and if you’re looking for a good moisturizer (and aren’t too picky about shallow details) give this a try!

##Worth the Try

I used my points for a trial size version of this to try it out because I was spending $50 on GlamGlow’s moisturizer and I did not feel or see my skin being moisturized. I LOVE this one from First Aid Beauty and I will definitely be buying the full size version when the trial size tube runs out (which should last me a while!) Since using this, I have had less flaky skin and dry patches and I can FEEL the difference as well. I have super sensitive skin so I was worried about it breaking me out, but it hasn’t at all. I’m so glad I gave this a try.


Negative: 
Competitor: $50 on GlamGlow’s moisturizer

##One 6oz tub later…

So for about a year this has been the only moisturizer I have used, I have gone through an entire 6oz tub and recently repurchased another because I like this product a lot.

To begin with, I can say with certainty that this product really did improve the redness in my skin with continuous use, but the results are not instantaneous. It takes weeks of using the cream to see improvement but after going through a full tub I can say my cheeks and nose aren’t constantly red anymore which is what I was looking for. It also is an effective moisturizer that doesn’t leave my face looking or feeling greasy or shiny which is a plus for me.

Sometimes it does sting my skin, like other reviewers have mentioned, when I apply this but all the moisturizers and creams I have ever used have done this at one point or another. It also only stings my skin when I apply it after doing a more aggressive treatment or serum with acids so it could be that another product is senstizing my skin and then this on top just exacerbates it a little. It’s nothing that has made me concerned enough to discontinue use because of how infrequent it is and how it only happens when I’m using more “aggressive” treatments on my face for lack of a better term.

Overall, I really am dedicated to this moisturizer. It’s a good amount of product for the price and it really is a simple cream that’s effective at reducing redness. It won’t really do anything else for your skin, so I can see how this wouldn’t be for everyone but it really works for my dry and fairly sensitive skin.


Negative: 
Allergy: only stings my skin when I apply

Positive: 
Skin: improve the redness in my skin
Price: amount of product for the price
##Stings

It stings my skin once I apply it. I would not recommend for sensitive or dry skin .

##Made bumpy skin and red spots go away IMMEDIATELY

I have EXTREMELY sensitive and dry skin. I had an allergy puff up scare with parabens a few years ago, so I've been extra careful. A few days ago, I decided to treat myself and use my old skincare regimen (Sunday Riley CEO Serum and Moisturizer): I got bumps under my skin, dryness, and red spots breaking out. :( 
I decided to reuse my First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream (this item), and WOW. Just wow. RIGHT after, RIGHT after it settled, the bumps were ALL gone. I kid you not, my whole face felt smooth. I'm sure after a few days, my red spots/acne will also disappear. WOW. Just, I don't know why I ever left this product. 
If your skin is in trouble, use this (also use the First Aid Beauty FAB Pharma Arnica Relief & Rescue Mask).


Positive: 
Skin: bumpy skin and red spots go away, EXTREMELY sensitive and dry skin
Sentiment: First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream (this item), and WOW

Negative: 
Competitor: Sunday Riley CEO Serum
##Restored my skin barrier

this cream absolutely saved my skin. I just recently started getting into skincare so I have been experimenting with new products. I started using a cleanser twice a day and didnt realize right away that it was severely damaging my skin barrier. Obviously I have changed cleansers since but my skin still felt desiccated for a while. I tried so many different moisturizers that were not delivering the hydration my skin was in desperate need of. This cream was a game changer!!! highly recommend for anyone with parched, dry skin.


Positive: 
Performance: Restored my skin barrier
Sentiment: this cream absolutely saved my skin
Skin: recommend for anyone with parched, dry skin

Negative: 
None
##Perfect for sensitive skin

THIS as a day moisturizer saved me when I went back to using retin-a. It was great to keep my skin moisturized during the day but now after my skin went from super dry to it's old condition - oily/combination - it is too oily for me to use during the day which is why I like to put it on at night or for especially dry patches.


Positive: 
Skin: Perfect for sensitive skin, great to keep my skin moisturized

Negative: 
Skin: oily/combination - it is too oily
##might’ve worked on others but not my skin

May have worked for others but for me it was a no no , soon as I placed it on my face it burned I thought to myself maybe it’s suppose to burn but then it felt unlike other moisturizers I had used it felt like it was just there so I took it off & it felt so relieving bc I no longer burned once I washed off


Negative: 
Allergy: my face it burned

Positive: 
None
##so good!

This stuff is so thick. But it’s amazing. My skin feels amazing the next day. I have the worlds most sensitive skin and this doesn’t irritate it at all! Highly recommend!

##Better than $$$ moisturizer

Absolutely love this moisturizer!! I use pharmaceutical grade skin care, and this moisturizer works better for me that my $$$ one from my Medspa! Very lightweight, very hydrating. I use on my face, neck and chest and have noticed great results with overall moisture and plumpness. Just purchased my second tub!!


Positive: 
Application: face, neck and chest
Purchase: purchased my second tub!!

Negative: 
Competitor: one from my Medspa
##Don’t think, just BUY!!

This cream is AMAZING! I had a bad reaction to a moisturiser which made my skin extremely dry, flaky and burnt, but this saved it. It actually repaired my skin in just a week and since then I am using it and will never stop or switch over to any other moisturiser.


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: repaired my skin
##Irritation?? Eucalyptus is a no for sensitivity!

I liked the texture but the cream burnt my face and made it even redder and irritated. I think it was the eucalyptus in it. So if you're sensitive to that maybe steer clear of this product. I wanted to like it but my skin was not having it.


Positive: 
None

Negative: 
Ingredients: Eucalyptus is a no for sensitivity
Allergy: but the cream burnt my face
Skin: made it even redder
##I DONT UNDERSTAND. THIS IS MAGIC

i never really write reviews but THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. i have heard great things about this product but i was NOT expecting this cream to literally make my jaw drop. I have very dry skin and this moisturizes my skin beautifully. I swear this product is magic?? it made my skin the smoothest its ever been. it goes in deep and evens everything out. do yourself a favor and just buy this. its the best facial moisturizer i have ever put on my face. ever.

##HOLY GRAIL!!

This moisturizer was such a game changer for me! I have rosacea so my skin tends to get red and soooo dry to the point that my skin would get flaky & itchy. I always aim for products that state to soothe any redness and I’ve tried different products but this has been the only one that has worked!! My skin feels instantly hydrated and it lasts throughout the day unlike other moisturizers which only work for a couple of hrs. This was perfect for my sensitive skin, other products would irritate my skin but using this I no longer have flaky dry itchy skin anymore. I honestly wish I would of bought this sooner!!


Positive: 
Sentiment: HOLY GRAIL!!
Skin: have rosacea, skin would get flaky, feels instantly hydrated, no longer have flaky dry itchy
Texture: lasts throughout the day

Negative:

##LOVE!

I have sensitive skin prone to getting oily and greasy so I only use ‘heavy’ moisturizers at night, but i still notice it’s effects when i wake up. Tthis moisturizes my skin on a new level without making me break out. I do think having this in my routine has made my face able to go makeup free more often!


Positive: 
Skin: sensitive skin prone to getting oily
Allergy: without making me break out

Negative: 
None
##Wasn’t BAD, but wasn’t amazing

I have normal/combination-oily skin and I really just get annoying dry patches around my mouth. It was the beginning of winter and I bought this cream because of its description and hydration claims. It worked fine, my skin didn’t dislike it but I felt like it only ~somewhat~ helped with my dryness, like the patches were still there if a little bit better. Maybe I was expecting too much in the first place? But after a couple months I bought the Neutrogena hydro boost water gel and felt like that moisturized my skin better and made it softer and smoother. Definitely not a bad product and I’m glad it’s worked so well for so many people, but was only average for me.


Negative: 
Skin: dry patches around my mouth, ~somewhat~ helped with my dryness

Negative: 
Allergy: stung a bit

Positive: 
Skin: amazing for dry skin
##Ooh ooh, that smell!

Ultra Repair Cream may have intense hydration as advertised but I just can't live with the intense lingering stink. I have studied various reviews to see if it has been mentioned before but alas, perhaps my sense of smell may be off but this product is one stink, stank, stunk for me!


Negative:

Odor: can't live with the intense lingering stink

##Life Changing

I seriously can't say enough amazing things about this product. I have very dry skin, and it has helped moisturize my skin so well! My friends who have oily skin use this product as well, and it has never caused them to break out. It's so moisturizing, soothing, and also great for sensitive skin! It also works great under makeup, I've never had a problem wearing it under makeup!

##saved me from chlorine dryness

I recently started swimming every day and the chlorine wrecked my skin--it became so dry, painful, and red. I knew my old moisturizer wouldn't cut it so I took a chance on this one and my skin went back to normal after the first use! No stinging, no irritation, no breakouts. And no irritating fragrance. The texture doesn't dry down to feel oily, and my face stays hydrated all day.


Positive: 
Skin: saved me from chlorine dryness
Performance: skin went back to normal
Odor: no irritating fragrance

##A LIFESAVER

I have extremely sensitive skin and never try anything new unless absolutely necessary. I also developed a bad case of perioral dermatitis from mask wearing this past year and was on a 6 week regimen of oral and topical antibiotics. We were preparing for a vacation to Hawaii and I was concerned about my skin and what would happen with the stricter outdoor mask regulations along with the change in climate (we live in AZ). Luckily I had this cream with me! I developed a really bad heat rash on my face in two different places  (I think the humidity with the mask was disastrous for me-my skin is use to the desert! ) it was so RED, itchy and bumpy! On a whim I tried this ultra repair cream and it instantly took the redness out and gave me relief! I was amazed! It worked wonders on the little sunburn I got on my shoulders the first day too! I used it everyday on my heat rash while we were on vacation -I would have been miserable without this little lifesaver!


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Skin: extremely sensitive skin, bad case of perioral dermatitis, instantly took the redness out, worked wonders on the little sunburn, used it everyday on my heat rash

##Truly Healing

I have rosacea, am prone to acne, eczema, and combination/dry skin.  I have precancerous scaly skin spots called DSAP and AK.  This is the only moisturizer I have used for 3 years.  I love it.  I started using this because I once had an eczema breakout on my eyelid, and I was terrified to put anything on it, but it kept getting worse over the month.  I saw this at the store and bought it out of desperation, used it on my skin on another eczema outbreak on my hand for a week and realized my skin had never felt so relieved and it healed there, so I tried it on my very delicate eyelid (a super tiny amount) and it worked! Within a week it was gone.  This stuff is amazing.  I only use it on my face now because it is pretty expensive for me, but I love it and will continue to use it.

##Dry Skin Miracle

Life changing! I have super sensitive and extremely dry skin. Almost every skin care I have ever tried made my skin bright red and itchy, but this ultra repair night cream with the oat toner is a life saver. In 3 months, I have gone from skin that looked like scales to smooth, plump, soft skin.  If I get lazy and don’t wash my face one day, I feel the dryness returning. So, I have to be consistent. But, I’m so thankful to finally find something for my nightmare skin! 

I also put this on my son’s eczema prone skin on his face. No dry patches for him either.

##"intense" hydration where?

When I went to apply this I was expecting something more creamy and thick lotion because of its claims as "intense" moisture. Whats inside reminds me a lot like a moisturizer I used in my teens in the 2000s - I can't recall the name but it was in a blue container much like this and it had a minty smell to it. I think it started with a z or x? Anyway, not important. I specifically purchased because of its raved reviews and well.. what it says in the name "ultra repair cream" "intense hydration". This did not provide any of those things for my dry face. My face felt more dry and looked so dehydrated 10 min after application. I also think it didn't help with any redness or acne - I think it make it worse. Now, the three starts because I have been using this on my daughter's hands which were abused all winter from not wearing gloves when she should and constantly washing her hands in school. I will say this lotion has helped with her scaley like texture hands. Will continue to use as a hand lotion for myself and my daughter (but if you want a hand lotion there are plenty of cheaper options available obviously) I would not recommend for anyone who has a dry-acne prone face like mine.


Negative: 
Skin: "intense" hydration where?, not provide any of those things for my dry, looked so dehydrated 10 min after, didn't help with any redness or acne, dry-acne prone face

Serious hydration when you have dry skin. For me it sinks in pretty quick and doesn’t leave a residue. I use this in dry areas as spot treatment and the dry area is gone in a day or two.

##fantastic!!

I bought this during the Black Friday sale and I can’t stress enough how this might be one of the best purchases I’ve ever made.
I rotate what I use for moisturizers and this was my first purchase with this product and brand for that matter. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. I don’t usually have sensitive skin but some times I do have sensitive skin and what ever I may be dealing with anything from redness, to bumps/irritation to hydration this moisture is so helpful. It doesn’t have a scent or fragrance. It’s glides on silky smooth and leaves your skin feeling supple as it absorbs into your skin. It doesn’t take too long for it to absorb into my skin and it’s the farthest thing from greasy. This moisturize is lovely and I couldn’t recommend it more!!! Don’t hesitate to purchase if your considering it. You truly won’t regret it.

##New favorite moisturizer

I love this moisturizer.  I use it with my Tret and I barely get any dryness.  Before I wouldn't be able to use my Tret more than once a week.  This stuff is awesome and makes my skin look so good after using it.  I wish they had a larger size but not in tub form.

##why fragrance and why silicones? :(

this cream is 90% perfect but it has dimethicone, which always breaks me out, and the eucalyptus is super strong (and essential oils break your skin down over time). i love it so much that i used almost the WHOLE jar before i figured out what was giving me all these little pimples! it's a travesty lol. i gave the rest to my friend who likes silicons and girl she's all over it. i just wish i could join her!!! this cream is hella rich and good value considering it's a sephora product and it made me dry patches disappear and even helped my dark spots but sadly i can't keep using it until they have a silicon-free version :( (and frangrance-free would be great too!!)

but tbh w you ill prob go back to this eventually lol it's that good


Negative: 
Ingredients: but it has dimethicone, eucalyptus is super strong
Allergy: always breaks me out, giving me all these little pimples

Positive:

##BEST night moisturizer

Love this cream!! I have dry, sensitive, eczema prone skin and this is the BEST night moisturizer. A little too heavy for my liking for during the day, but I use it every night and my skin is so calm in the morning.


Positive: 
Skin: Love this cream!! I have dry, sensitive, eczema prone skin

Negative: 
Texture: little too heavy
##crack in a jar I swear

This stuff changed my skin forever!!! I swear it’s like crack. My skin feels so plump and moisturized every morning after wearing this to bed. My skin used to be overly oily until I really started making moisturizing a priority. It’s not as oily and it’s much more glowy and even and plump after using this product.


Positive: 
Sentiment: stuff changed my skin forever
Skin: plump and moisturized, used to be overly oily, not as oily
Performance: it’s much more glowy

Negative:

##Not for my skin

Purchased because it’s advertised as a sensitive skin product, but it ultimately ended up not being compatible with my skin. It’s unfortunate because it’s a product that seems to work really well for most people and comes at an extremely reasonable price point.


Negative: 
Performance: not being compatible with my skin

Motivation: because it’s advertised as a sensitive skin
Price: comes at an extremely reasonable price point.
##A Dream

I genuinely never write reviews but this stuff IS IT! I struggle with acne during my time of the month and my skin is always dry. This stuff soaks right in and keeps it hydrated all day! Not oily, greasy or too heavy. Hasn't broken me out and my skin looks more supple. Will buy this forever.

##My absolute favorite

This stuff is my holy grail of moisturizers! I am literally in love with this stuff. My skin gets so so dry in the winter and this saves my skin overnight!

##Worst Cream - Ever!

I was so excited to try this out as an alternative to moisturizers with fragrance in them. My skin reacted - BADLY to this cream. Every time I would use it all of my pores would become extremely clogges and I started having breakouts everywhere. This lasted for a while until I was able to narrow down the culprit to this product. I have officially stopped using this cream for 5 days and my skin has already started to clear up and go back to normal. This stuff is now foot cream.

Performance: kin reacted - BADLY t
Allergy: all of my pores would become extremely clogges, tarted having breakouts everywhere

##Love!! Highly Recommend!

This stuff is so amazing! So hydrating without leaving me with a “greasy” feeling. Honestly, FAB can do no wrong in my book. This product is definitely worth it. Added bonus, this has completely brought my hands back to life - which were SO Dry from constant hand washing.

##Prices increased...

They went from an amazing 8oz tube for $34 and now they are at a higher price for only 6oz.  And now we can only spread around bacteria in a jar instead of have the tube they used to have.  Finding a different moisturizer now.  Hate the changes for their benefit.

Price: higher price for only 6oz

##Favorite body moisturizer

My favorite moisturizer for all over my body, hands, feet, and my face if I’m extra dry. I was skeptical of cost at first but at first use I realized a little goes a long way! Already purchased my second order!


Negative: 
None

Positive: 
Purchase: Already purchased my second order
##Sits on skin- Pills right off

I have dry skin and this sits on my skin. It pills right off and doesn't take to my skin at all. I got LaRoche Soothing Moisturizer and absolutely love it!

Skin: dry skin and this sits on my skin
Allergy: pills right off

##Price Significantly Increased Since Last Year

I’ve been using this product for years. I have combination skin with slight rosacea. I logged on to repurchase and noticed a significant price increase! Exactly a year ago I purchased the 2oz WITH a lip gloss for $12. It’s now listed at $16 for the 2oz only. I understand prices increase over time but a 33% increase in only 1 year is excessive. It’s a decent moisturizer but it’s not that much better than other, less expensive brands. Sadly they lost a customer with that extreme price hike.


Positive: 
Skin: combination skin, light rosacea

Negative: 
Price: Price Significantly Increased, noticed a significant price increas
Purchase: Sadly they lost a customer with that extreme price hike
##Over Hyped for Super Dry Skin

I am almost finished the mini bottle and overall I'm not impressed. I have super dry skin with rosacea and this didn't keep me moisturized enough. It sits on top of my skin which doesn't bother me but I wish it did more for me. Every single time I apply it, it tingles horribly for a moment. Almost the same as an AHA/BHA peel does. I would still say give it a shot if you aren't super dry or oily as it obviously has great reviews. This just wasn't for me.


Positive: 
None

##Life Saver!

##Great to not perfect!

The reason why I give this cream 3 stars is because it's great, but it doesn't "improve" your skin. I'm 32 with sensitive skin and I need a product that provides a better complexion and a good glow but this product does not do that. This cream hydrate my skin very well and keeps it stable. When I test another product that gives me irritation, I always go back to First Aid and it somehow relieves my symptom. Overall, it's a solid product, but I wish it did more.

This is my HG moisturizer! I have combo/sensitive skin that gets more dry in the winter, but this moisturizer is amazing all year round. It is the most hydrating cream I've ever used! It's lightweight as well and my skin feels so soft. I've had this for a few months now and I can tell this moisturizer will last me a good while. If you are thinking about buying this, do it.

##Excellent for Dry Skin

I got a deluxe sample tube of this in my Allure subscription box last month, and it arrived just in time for winter skin season! This works especially well for my dry hands, especially after washing dishes or cleaning. I find that it makes a great base layer to apply my shea butter, because it seems to help the shea absorb more quickly. My boyfriend has sensitive skin and eczema, and he really loves this. It's very gentle but effective and not greasy. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good all-around skin cream.

##This moisturizer is AMAZING!

This cream saved me! I gave birth to twins last year. Typically, I have used a lot of fancy creams with several steps: remove make-up, cleanse, tone, essence, serum, moisturize eyes, neck and face. Last year when I was horribly sleep deprived with our twins, I really only had time for one step and that was this! I wasn't wearing any make-up, so all I did was smear this all over my face for about 3 months until I started to get a bit more sleep and had time to put make-up on. During that time, I ran out of it, and my face started feeling dull and dry. I couldn't believe the difference without it. So, I've kept it in my beauty routine, and it's the one thing my face gets upset about when missing. When I first tried it, it didn't feel like it was doing much, but when it was missing, I realized how much it was doing for my skin and how the texture of my skin is much better with it.

##Miracle for Accutane users

Love this. I took Accutane during an extremely cold winter, and so that combination of weather and medication dried out my skin severely. I couldn't really wear makeup because I was so flaky and peeling...makeup never looked right.  I bought this and put it on my face right after washing... did NOT towel my face dry. I left my face fairly wet and put this cream right on top. Within two weeks my skin was manageable, I was wearing makeup again, and my skin stayed healthy throughout the rest of my Accutane course. I cannot recommend it highly enough!

##love this hydrating cream!

I have been experiencing redness and dryness on my cheeks since fall. I get very dry and irritated skin during winter months as it’s very dry where I live. I generally have oily t-zone. So it’s hard to find products that work on my face and don’t clog pores and make me breakout. I literally picked up this cream to try and bought the smallest size. It worked so great on my cheeks and nose to minimize the redness and get rid of dry patches. I was thrilled to see the results, it was better than I expected. I use this cream twice a day underneath my regular Belif moisturizer and my skin has dramatically improved. My doctor gave me topical ointment for rosacea but surprisingly only this worked. I am becoming a fan of this skincare line. The best part is that it can be used anywhere from face, eyes to elbows and even legs.

##LOVE IT

LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I've tried out multiple skin creams and this one is my saving grace. After taking off my makeup and my face needs hydration, this is the answer! This gives my face so much hydration, I love it! Even after a shower, it keeps my face hydrated! Especially when it gets cold outside, my skin gets dry and weird, so far it's been good. I also have a bit of eczema on my finger, so I put a dot of this cream there and my eczema has been tamed, thankfully!

##INCREDIBLE

Sometimes I’ll use benzoyl peroxide to treat acne but it’s super drying on my skin such that my face felt rough and sandy. My current moisturizer wasn’t hydrating enough so I decided to try this product out and I’m so glad I did! My skin feels so nice when I apply this cream. For the first few minutes it felt soothing and tingly in a good way. I have combination skin and acne-prone but this doesn’t break me out at all. I’ve actually noticed that I stopped developing blemishes after I started using this cream!! I bought the 2 oz size but once I finish that I’ll definitely go for the big tub size. New favorite moisturizer!!!

Application: benzoyl peroxide

##Game changer!

This is my holy grail item to keep my dry, sensitive, eczema prone skin in check. I discovered FAB's Ultra Repair Cream when I was on a Sephora trip looking desperately for help with my skin. I was skeptical about this cream, but it made a difference immediately. I love that it's thick enough to keep my dry skin hydrated, but doesn't turn me into a greaseball. 

I struggled with the tub packaging though- I didn't like the idea of sticking my dirty fingers into the tub. However, that has since be resolved with disposable spatulas from Amazon. 

This inexpensive cream is a game changer for those with dry skin. I use it mostly during the winter and I always have some handy with my in my purse, just in case. Highly recommended!

##Great for Accutane Users!

I used this during my 8 months on 80 mg of accutane (it was rough!) and this was one of the only moisturizers that kept my skin feeling somewhat hydrated. It has a thick formula which I love. I have been off accutane for 6 months now and I continue to use it as the weather gets colder and my skin starts to dry out. Works like a charm!!

##Hydrating, creamy texture

I've been on the hunt for a new moisturizer for the past 4 months and I think I may have found it. The texture of this cream is absolutely gorgeous with its dense, silky, but non-greasy consistency. When you first apply it feels as if it may be occlusive but quickly melts into the into the skin, hydrating and moisturizing without any residue or greasiness. I like to layer this with my marula oil and vitamin  C the combination gives you this radiant glow from within. I must say compared to similar moisturizers with much higher price points, this is truly a fantastic value for the quality and quantity of product you receive. Plus I think the jar will definitely last for some time.

##Absolute HG Product

This moisturizer is amazing! It is great for almost every skin type, and age group. It is hydrating but not greasy or watery. If you are oily DO NOT BE SCARED  of the words "intense hydration" it won't break you out or make you too oily, and if you are dry it still provides enough daily hydration. I used to have a very complicated skin care routine filled with oils and serums and scrubs for my oily skin. Once I committed to using this as my only moisturizer I saw a huge change. Now this is part of a two or three step skin care routine I do every day which is a big change from my previous seven/eight steps. There is no secret to this product, no special protein from the sea or water gathered from the purest cloud or something, it is just simple plain ingredients. If you don't like the pot they also sell it in a squeezy tube. As moisturizers go, this is really reasonably priced! The pot or tube lasts forever so the cost per use is brought down to pennies.  If you are even mildly considered it, regardless of age or skin type I would definitely recommend giving it a try. TL/DR 10/10 would recommend to ANYONE

##TOO GOOD

I first tried this kind of by accident when I forgot moisturizer on a weekend trip and a friend let me use this. I ordered it before I even got home! I have really unmanageable skin, super prone to terrible acne but also somewhat sensitive and occasionally very dry. I tried a lot of moisturizers, ranging from heave duty ones like clinique dramatically different, which worked well for a week or two and then made me break out all over, to oil-free moisturizers for acne prone skin that never made my skin feel really hydrated. This stuff is seriously the best. I now use the ultra repair cleanser and face moisturizer as well. I am usually very oily and my face will be shiny by mid day, but somehow I feel like this makes me more matte while super hydrated at the same time. This is truly the perfect product. I will buy it as long as it stays with this formula


Positive: 
Demographic: weekend trip
Motivation: a friend let me use
Skin: unmanageable skin, terrible acne, sensitive, very oily, super hydrated

##Very hydrating!

Prior to purchasing this cream, my face had broken out into a horrible rash. My skin goes through hormonal breakouts every month, but I knew this time my eczema had spread to my face. (I suffer from eczema on my hands every winter.) After reading many reviews and trying endless products, I decided to give this cream a chance. Within the first 2 days, my eczema started clearing up. Now almost a week later, my skin has completely recovered from this dry spell! I mix this with my current holy grail night cream and the results have been astonishing. My skin is significantly more hydrated and glowing! I have also applied it to the eczema spots on my hands and it seems to be helping to keep it hydrated as well. Overall, this is an amazing cream for a good price! I'll keep this in my routine from now on!

##such a disappointment

I don’t get the hype. I use Retin A so can have a bit of dryness and flaking but 2 days into this I was having cracked skin which I haven’t had. I could use a 10$ product with better results. PTR water drench is MUCH better moisture and doesn’t pill. I’d recommend that for ceramides over this! I even tried the night one and I’d swear it’s the same product in a different tub, feels the same, smells the same, and just as dry. Sad because it is so hyped up I expected it to be better than Algenist Genius cream which is great too and has a ceramide just the same. Also I do believe it made me break out on my cheek!

Motivation: the hype
Application: Retin A, the night one

##BEST MOISTURIZER EVER!

In general, I love First Aid Beauty as a whole because every product is AMAZING for sensitive skin. When I got this, I was hoping it wouldn't disappoint, and it didn't. This moisturizer is very light and PERFECT for everyday wear. I have very dry, sensitive skin, and this product is perfect for me. I hope that whoever is reading this gets the chance to buy or receive this AMAZING product. The travel size of this product is fairly large compared to other travel size moisturizers. The travel size tube is about 5 1/2 inches tall and 2 inches wide. Yes, I love this product so much that I measured it. Every morning and night, I use a pea sized amount of the product and the travel size lasted around 4-5 months until I had to buy a new one. I will DEFINITELY look forward to buying the value size because I love this SO MUCH. GO FIRST AID BEAUTY!

##Sure there's bad reviews, but it's REALLY good.

This product worked really well for me, I have combination skin and this moisturizer works wonders! It didn't make me break out whatsoever, but it hydrated all the parched zones on my face. Especially after getting a break out or pimple, the skin around that spot becomes very dry and flaky for me, so i simply just wash my face and then apply this lotion. It leaves my face so soft and doesn't make me feel oily at all. It's really great too if you're the kind of person who washes their face daily, especially with something more intense like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. Usually after washing my face for 3 days straight or so my face becomes very dry and tight, sometimes it cracks, but this lotion has completely resolved that issue. It's the only moisturizer I want to use on my face, and works amazing on your hands or feet as well. I feel that many of the bad reviews come from people who have allergies they're not aware of or have extremely sensitive skin, causing them to break out. But for the majority of people it works amazingly.


Positive: 
Sentiment: product worked really well
Skin: combination skin, moisturizer works wonders!, hydrated all the parched, very dry and flaky, only moisturizer I want to use
Texture: break out, so soft, feel oily

##Can't beat this price!

First, can we talk about how you get 6oz for $30?! Compared to most moisturizers that sell for $40  for only 1.7oz... This really is a steal! Anyway, I was a little worried this cream would leave a white cast on my face because that usually happens with white moisturizers... but it didn't! Also I had a lot of dry, peeling skin around my mouth and this moisturizer   exfoliating did the trick.
The only downside is the product has a bad smell when applying; but afterwards the smell is gone.


Positive: 
Price: 6oz for $30
Performance: leave a white cast
Skin: peeling skin, moisturizer   exfoliating
Application: my mouth

Negative:

##Helped with my baby’s eczema
