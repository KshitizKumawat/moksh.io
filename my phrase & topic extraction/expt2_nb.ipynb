My hands, especially during winter, tend to crack and bleed at the knuckles and cuticles especially. I finally caved and bought the ultra repair cream. It was amazing! The cream was thick, absorbing relatively quickly. It did cause a little burning at first because my hands were so dry and cracked. That subsided after 10 minutes max. I finally saw my skin looking normal and it did take away the small eczema-looking patch on my arm within a week. I was so amazed by this cream, I stocked up and would have anywhere from 5-10+ 14oz jars on hand at any given time and also bought this every year for Christmas for family and friends.\\n\\nThen I started to noticed the formula was becoming thinner and not working as well as it used to. I noticed my skin going back to the way it was. \\n\\nThen the price got outrageous $78 for a 14oz jar? Seems a little excessive for how much cream I was having to use. Then it was getting harder and harder to get their TSV on time for Christmas. Or even at all,  I had it on autodelivery for the Christmas pear fragrance and waited 2 months after it was supposed to ship and kept getting the run around. I finally cancelled it because I got sick of waiting and I havenâ€™t bought another product from them since. Then they stopped selling it! So I ended up going back to my old lotions that were less than 1/2 the price for more product.\\n\\n\\nPositive: \\nDemographic: especially during winter,\\nTexture: cream was thick, absorbing relatively quickly\\nSkin: take away the small eczema-looking patch on my arm\\nPackaging: 14oz jars\\nPurchase: every year for Christmas\\n\\nNegative: \\nApplication: Used to be great product 3+ years ago\\nTexture: formula was becoming thinner\\nPrice: $78 for a 14oz jar\\nShipping: TSV on time for Christmas, waited 2 months\\n##hydration is key\\n\\nlove this moisturizer, i use it as my morning moisturizer and makes me feel hydrated\\n\\n\\nPositive: \\nMotivation: morning moisturizer\\nSkin: feel hydrated\\n\\nNegative: \\nNone\\n##Worth it! Calms rosacea\\n\\nI have rosacea and super sensitive skin and I wanted a moisturizer I could use daily that wouldnâ€™t aggravate my skin, but rather calm it down a bit. Enter this cream: at first, I didnâ€™t think it did anything at all, but the more I used it, the smoother my skin got (less texture from the rosacea) and I saw a different in my redness on my face. As soon as you apply it to irritated and hot skin, itâ€™s so cooling and feels so nice! I use it after Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and it feels great. Also, for the person who said that this is just a more expensive version of Cerave â€” I disagree. Not all moisturizers work for everyone â€” for some reason, Cerave doesnâ€™t work well at all with my skin, but FAB ultra hydrating cream truly does soothe it. Worth the price for the tub because Iâ€™ve only used about 1/5th of it and Iâ€™ve been using it every day for about 3 months now!\\n\\n\\nNegative: \\nCompetitor: Cerave doesnâ€™t work well at all with my skin\\n\\nPositive: \\nMotivation: wouldnâ€™t aggravate my skin, calm it down a bit\\nTexture: smoother my skin\\nPerformance: cooling and feels so nice\\nCompetitor: after Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser\\nPrice: Worth the price for the tub\\nDemographic: every day for about 3 months\\n\""
