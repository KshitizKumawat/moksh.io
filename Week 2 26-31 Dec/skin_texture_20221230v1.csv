"Disastrous formula change.

I've been using this FAB cream for almost a decade. I have spent thousands of dollars on just this one cream - I've got a whole family with sensitive skin and we live in an area with very harsh winters. We've bought uncounted tubes and tubs of this stuff (as well as now-discontinued fragrances, rip coconut lime). This used to be the absolute best cream you could buy for a variety of concerns - dry skin, acne, eczema, flakiness, EVERYTHING. The scent was pleasant and the texture, once it sunk in, left your skin actually soft but never greasy and weird. Holy Grail, totally deserving of every accolade it received. 

Welp. Over the last year that's almost all changed. The fragrance is more or less the same, but I suddenly noticed my hands and face weren't staying as nice as they used to. My family agrees: the cream isn't soothing eczema or flakiness anymore, nor helping prevent dryness. The texture is no longer thick and luscious but feels watery and insubstantial when applied. Once it's rubbed in, skin now seems mildly tacky, not soft or moisturized. Any sensation of moisture wears off quickly. 

I can't tell what they've done to the formula besides the addition of eucalyptus, but it is a catastrophic change. This product used to be five stars, now it's one. A pump bottle of any drugstore brand with oatmeal will serve you much better. I also want to note they have raised the price on the 8oz tube by TWELVE DOLLARS over the last six years - and I'd still be willing to pay if it wasn't worse than a drugstore product. But as it stands I'm heartbroken. Don't waste your money."
"Used to be great product 3+ years ago, not anymore

Let me start by saying I loved this product so much when I first started using it. My hands, especially during winter, tend to crack and bleed at the knuckles and cuticles especially. I finally caved and bought the ultra repair cream. It was amazing! The cream was thick, absorbing relatively quickly. It did cause a little burning at first because my hands were so dry and cracked. That subsided after 10 minutes max. I finally saw my skin looking normal and it did take away the small eczema-looking patch on my arm within a week. I was so amazed by this cream, I stocked up and would have anywhere from 5-10+ 14oz jars on hand at any given time and also bought this every year for Christmas for family and friends.

Then I started to noticed the formula was becoming thinner and not working as well as it used to. I noticed my skin going back to the way it was. 

Then the price got outrageous $78 for a 14oz jar? Seems a little excessive for how much cream I was having to use. Then it was getting harder and harder to get their TSV on time for Christmas. Or even at all,  I had it on autodelivery for the Christmas pear fragrance and waited 2 months after it was supposed to ship and kept getting the run around. I finally cancelled it because I got sick of waiting and I haven’t bought another product from them since. Then they stopped selling it! So I ended up going back to my old lotions that were less than 1/2 the price for more product."
"peeling

Ive been using this everyday for about a month its very moisturizing and feels great when applying but, if you apply too much or if you you don’t wait long enough to apply other products it peels right off when you touch your face"
"ABSOLUTE NO!!

This cream is very lightweight and has a whipped texture. It smells like oats which was weird in the beginning  but I got used to it. It is intended for dry to very dry skin however I didn’t find it hydrating enough. I used it from september to march so basically winter and it wasn’t cut out for this weather. See its ingredients include oat, ceramides, niacinamide, and MANY silicones. The problem with this was that the cream left this residue which was clearly due to the silicones. It was very fast absorbing and I needed alot of product in order to feel moisturized. When I washed my face it felt like there was a layer of cream sitting there so I didn’t like that at all. Also, I think because of the niacinamide there was a BURNING sensation for many days when I first started using it but I got used to it eventually. I’ve never had a cream that lasted me such a short time. I think this cream would suit summers cuz it wasn’t enough for the winter here and summers here get very humid so it would literally just melt off cuz of the silicones. There were many times I outright hated how it made my skin feel so I don’t think I would use it again."
"smells bad, feels weird.

I'm glad I got this as a sample, because I don't think I can finish this...it smells like vomit and doesn't feel like it cleans my combination skin. I really wanted to give it a chance, slightly holding my breath while rubbing it on my face, and made it through most of the tube (the sample size was fairly decent), and I didn't notice any results, just a weird waxy coating. I would not purchase this. And for real, I can't emphasize how bad it smells."
"Not reliable. Petro fishy mold smell again.

I've been buying the Full size unscented Ultra Repair Cream for a few years and I notice this jar and my 2nd jar is off. Petro chemical fishy mold smell again. Cream doesn't glide on or absorb right it stays on top of my face and hands too. It's almost like there is too much oil in it. I'm moving on to a more reliable less chemical smelling deep moisturizing cream."
"Will not be purchasing again

Awful smell and feels very tacky on the skin. Definitely not worth the price!"
"Not for me

Thick, making my skin clog. Use very lightly. Also pills if you try and put any makeup over top of it, flaking everything off. I only use it midday while working from home if I need a little pick me up. Such a specific use case, I won't repurchase."
"Super Hydrating Cream

This cream can be a little thick and heavy in application if you use a lot but I apply it lightly in the summer and heavier in the winter depending on my skin’s needs. Since I have hyper sensitive skin, this cream with colloidal oatmeal formula has reduced redness patches and has helped in healing acne damage. I have used this product for more than two years and it has changed my life. It also has no fragrance and it does not feel or look greasy. I usually apply it at night or when my face needs extra love. I do wear it during the day with a lighter application. My skin can stay hydrated with this cream for up to 48 hours. I’ve experienced significantly less breakouts and I am very happy with my longterm results. I love it!"
"Hydrated skin is happy skin!

I have been using the First Aid Beauty Ultra repair cream intense hydration for about 2 months now. I originally bought the small ounce bottle and fell in love with the product and I immediately bought the 6 ounce. 

- It hydrates
- No grease feeling
- Left my skin looking smooth

All I could say if you do have oily skin, the hydration may be a bit too much, but for my combo skin/sensitive I felt like it was fine. 

I would definitely repurchase this product (:"
"eh

Overhyped, it’s just not that good. I don’t think it moisturizes my skin well and it’s too thick for no reason (same). There’s definitely better out there!"
"Greasy/oily

I got this as a sample. 1st impressions were it was instantly moisturizing and didn't have to wait for it to ""soak in"" my skin. Then I noticed the palms of my hands were very greasy and oily. I want to feel moisturized, not oily. I felt like I wanted to wash the oil off my hands but it'd defeat the whole purpose."
"New formula? Smells and applies like sunscreen

I used to love this cream. It was perfect for my face and body. No scent, easy to apply and quick to absorb. It looks like they changed their formula. Now it smells like sunscreen and it takes rubbing to get it to absorb. I won’t be using this again."
"Pills and feels weird on skin, disappointing

I was so excited to buy this because of all the great reviews I've seen for it, and I was pretty disappointed after a week a using it. My biggest complaint is how it pills. It's almost like it's not being absorbed into the skin and sits like a film that will ball up if you touch your face after applying. I tried different ways of applying (using less, using more, patting, rubbing, only rubbing it in for a certain amount of time, etc) and it did it every time. I honestly wouldn't mind it too much if it didn't mess up my makeup application- everything clings to the moisturizer now and looks grainy. My skin does feel softer after using consistently, but like I said earlier, it fills almost filmy. Plus, I don't think it lives up to the ""intense hydration"" name. I looked at recent reviews after I started seeing problems and apparently they changed their formula. My acne has cleared up with this though, and some of my redness has faded, so that's a nice quality of it. Will be returning though, the pilling and weird film feeling isn't worth the price in my opinion."
"Unbelievably Good

WOW! I live in a super dry area and I have been struggling to find a decent face moisturizer. Well this has easily become my holy grail moisturizer!!! Thick and smooth without being sticky/oily/chunky on the skin. I will never buy a different moisturizer again."
"not for combination skin

I’ve received this product as a free sample and have been using it for two days. I consider my skin a combination skin and I don’t think that was the best choice for me. My skin feels tacky right after applying the product, as if it didn’t absorb it, and during the morning I woke up with a very oily face. I expected more since it’s a very hyped product on social media."
"Booooooooo

My skin gets really dry in the winter so I gave this a try, but with every use it gave me more acne. I stopped for a week and my skin was clearing up. Gave it another try for a few days and the bumps came right back. It is very moisturizing but also somehow makes my skin look dull."
"Pleasant all-around lotion

For the price, this is a great purchase. It works well on body as well as face. It has a very slight medicinal smell, but it isn't unpleasant. It dries quickly and doesn't feel greasy."
"Drying, doesn't absorb well

I wanted to love the Ultra Repair Cream because of the hype, but it just didn't work for me. I found it to be super drying, almost like it left a cast on my skin. I'd have to use a facial oil underneath it each time I put it on, and it gave me dry patches around my nose, eyebrows, and hairline. It's gentle, which is great, and didn't irritate my acne-prone skin, but the cons outweigh the pros here in my opinion. Wasn't worth the price."
"At least worth a shot

This is a fairly decent moisturizer. It’s certainly not perfect in my book, but it has some really great qualities. First, I have come to develop mild eczema on my eyelids. Using a small amount around my eyelids has calmed some of the itching and cracking skin. Another redeeming quality is it’s longevity. I live in an aird climate and it’s very difficult to get moisturizer to stick around. This keeps my face soft and mostly hydrated throughout the day. It does a far better job than others I’ve tried (looking at you Tatcha and Drunk Elephant). Third, this is a great price for the quality of product. Especially with the value sets. 

I’m giving this four stars because this product seems to leave a (waxy-like? or silicone-like?) film over my face. I’m not sure how to describe it, but it feels like a residue of sorts. The initial texture is quite dreamy though. Also, I’m not a fan of the smell. Eucalyptus is okay, but it tends to smell kind of stale or perhaps  mildewy. Again, that might not be the correct word. 

Overall this is a great product for the price and if you’re looking for a good moisturizer (and aren’t too picky about shallow details) give this a try!"
"""intense"" hydration where?

When I went to apply this I was expecting something more creamy and thick lotion because of its claims as ""intense"" moisture. Whats inside reminds me a lot like a moisturizer I used in my teens in the 2000s - I can't recall the name but it was in a blue container much like this and it had a minty smell to it. I think it started with a z or x? Anyway, not important. I specifically purchased because of its raved reviews and well.. what it says in the name ""ultra repair cream"" ""intense hydration"". This did not provide any of those things for my dry face. My face felt more dry and looked so dehydrated 10 min after application. I also think it didn't help with any redness or acne - I think it make it worse. Now, the three starts because I have been using this on my daughter's hands which were abused all winter from not wearing gloves when she should and constantly washing her hands in school. I will say this lotion has helped with her scaley like texture hands. Will continue to use as a hand lotion for myself and my daughter (but if you want a hand lotion there are plenty of cheaper options available obviously) I would not recommend for anyone who has a dry-acne prone face like mine."
"BEST night moisturizer

Love this cream!! I have dry, sensitive, eczema prone skin and this is the BEST night moisturizer. A little too heavy for my liking for during the day, but I use it every night and my skin is so calm in the morning."
"Doesn’t live up to the hype

I want to love this cream because it has so many rave reviews by my combo skin doesn’t love it. I don’t use it all the time because my skin can go from dry to oily and back again in the blink of an eye so i often refrain from using creams unless my skin is parched. However, when I use this cream when my skin is feeling dry it often really stings when I apply it and it doesn’t really feel like my skin absorbs it at all. I will even slug with aquaphor over this cream in my driest areas and it doesn’t seem to do a whole lot. I have noticed though that it pills quite easily. I’m really disappointed because everyone seems to love this so much."
"flakes off the skin

I recently got on Accutane and started using this. It works as a moisturizer BUT once it dries to the skin it gets really flaky and clumpy. Sometimes after putting it on it looks like it is peeling off of my face and I look like I’m flaking dry skin everywhere. When I wake up or towards the end of the day, my skin looks dry because the product is flaking off. It works but I’m sure there are better options that don’t make you look flaky."
"grogu

I love this moisturizer. It's perfect for summertime. It doesn't break me out. However, I felt like it's not suitable for the winter months as the moisturizer isn't on the thicker side."
"NOPE!

Nope. Pills. Sits on the surface. DOESNT get absorbed."
"ATTENTION!! WARNING!

Maybe it’s just me, but I can literally scratch this product off of my face (hours after it has been applied) and have to scrape it out from under my nails afterward. I have combination skin (dry cheeks/oily t-zone) and this product doesn’t absorb anywhere on my face at all, rather it acts as a heavy layer of product on my skin. This moisturizer makes me feel like I have an oily/lotion-ey face all day long. I love the Hello FAB Coconut Water Cream by First Aid Beauty, and this product was such a disappointment compared to that. I bought this product in search of a better hydrating moisturizer, but I will not be purchasing it again and don’t recommend it to others (based off my own experience). I’m not sure what to do with the full container that I still have left.."
"Moisturizing, but greasy

This product is great at moisturizing as it took care of ALL of my winter dry skin. However, I have sensitive combination skin which breaks out often and moves back and forth between dry and oily depending on what products I use (which has been a constant battle of finding the right products) and this product was entirely too heavy. It sat on my skin, making my face greasy. I gave it three stars because it really does great things for dry skin but, as someone with combination skin, it wasn't a miracle product but an uncomfortable one. I returned it & won't be repurchasing."
"Don’t bother

Thankfully despite all the rave reviews, I only bought a mini size of this to try it for the first time because I did not take a liking to it. For starters, I have very dry/eczema prone skin, and this did not feel moisturizing enough for me at all despite its name. It felt too light weight, and didn’t absorb well. On top of that, the eucalyptus in it is way overpowering. There’s an overwhelming scent of it upon opening the jar. I’m not sure why they would include this known irritating ingredient in a product that’s supposed to be for sensitive skin. Upon giving this a few tries, I found it irritated my skin each time (I’m assuming it was the eucalyptus). I eventually decided to stop using it on my face. The only slightly positive thing is that I can keep it and just use it for the rest of my body with hopefully no issues. Definitely won’t repurchase though, will stick to the Cerave moisturizing cream."
"Not impressed

With the overwhelming good reviews I was excited to try this lotion but I feel very underwhelmed with it. I have to reapply it often as the lotion is thin and absorbs very quickly. It also has an off putting odor, it’s very mild but I have been using it every night before I go to bed and inevitably my hands end up near my face and I always get a whiff. I gave it two stars because I didn’t have any adverse reactions to it."
"Good quality, non greasy

I’m actually self conscious about how rough my hands are. They get dry and ashy if I don’t use lotion right after hand washing. I have oily skin so I don’t use this on my face, but it does feel pretty hydrating and isn’t greasy. For my hands I prefer Skinfix eczema hand cream which is pricey or okeeffe’s."
"LIFESAVING PRODUCT

This cream quite literally saved my skin.  I had overused my retinol gel because I stupidly didn't look into how to use it properly, and my skin, which is normally oily, became so parched and dehydrated that it was peeling.  My whole face became incredibly sensitive, so much so that my typical gel moisturizer was making my face sting.  The skin on my eyelids were red, irritated and peeling, and my undereyes could not even tolerate concealer.
This cream truly provides ""Intense Hydration"", but is also super lightweight and doesn't leave you feeling greasy.  The colloidal oatmeal really is soothing to my hypersensitivity.
After I purchased it (and had stopped using the retinol for 2 days), I applied a thick layer all over my face and continued to reapply every two hours.  It has been less than 24 hours and my skin is no longer stinging, my eyelids have stopped peeling and turning red, and my undereyes are plump.
I am excited to use it on the rest of my body, and can imagine that it is great for fake tan!"
"not particularly exciting or effective.

very meh: it kind of just sits on your skin, feels really thick and suffocating, and makes you super oily a few hours later."
"Great even if you have acne

I have combination acne prone skin and was searching for a daily moisturizer that would help protect my skin and also not cause more pimples. This is the one. Its on the heavier side, which I would normally shy away from, but this cream absorbs very well into my skin, leaving it feeling calm and soft. It has also never caused an acne flare up for me and instead seems to calm my skin. 
Before using this product my face was a mess of volcanic acne eruptions, complete with dark acne scars. ""Skin care"" for me meant scrubbing my face a thousand times a day and using every face mask under the sun. I stopped all that thank goodness, and started to treat my skin gently. This has worked wayyy better than bouncing between products and trying new harsh scrubs every other week. I now treat my skin as if it is sensitive and have a true routine using just a few products.  This product is key to that, and I use it night and day and night to protect my skin and calm any redness and irritation. I would definitely recommend trying this product - even if you don't end up loving it for your face, its great to use on your hands (especially because I'm washing them so often now). Each tub lasts a crazy long time too so the price is worth it."
"pretty nice

I like this cream as a final layer after I apply my night time retinoid. I also use it on my décolletage. It’s a rich but not oily cream. It stays tacky for a while after application, so it’s night time only for me."
"Best Cream Yet

I use this as a moisturizer for my face and neck and it does the trick. I don't wake up with a greasy face, and I don't get super oily during the day. Only thing is that it takes a while for my skin to absorb it, but other than that I love it so far!"
"SMELLS HORRIBLE!!!!

The smell is awful!!! The texture to this moisturizer is also horrible!! It does not rub in well and it feels weird on your skin. This was definitely not worth the price. Don’t recommend if you like creamy moisturizers that are more lightweight. This is very heavy and feels weird. Worst moisturizer I’ve ever used.  Save your money!"
"such a disappointment

I don’t get the hype. I use Retin A so can have a bit of dryness and flaking but 2 days into this I was having cracked skin which I haven’t had. I could use a 10$ product with better results. PTR water drench is MUCH better moisture and doesn’t pill. I’d recommend that for ceramides over this! I even tried the night one and I’d swear it’s the same product in a different tub, feels the same, smells the same, and just as dry. Sad because it is so hyped up I expected it to be better than Algenist Genius cream which is great too and has a ceramide just the same. Also I do believe it made me break out on my cheek!"
"A must-have product

Great choice for oily acne-prone skin. Works well with topicals and gives long-lasting results."
"love

I absolutely love this moisturizer!! It feels so nice on my skin and it doesn’t feel too heavy which I love!!"
"Best moisturizer I’ve ever tried

So thick and creamy, yet it doesn’t feel heavy and doesn’t leave you looking like a greasy mess."
"A cult classic you should try

It’s only my second favorite moisturizing cream, but it still gets a strong five stars. I loved the slightly whipped but still creamy texture, and it’s excellent bang for your buck. I love the whole concept behind FAB. 
Their oatmeal mask is one of my holy grail products that I never travel without. I think it might have been discontinued, but in any case, FAB knows how to deliver when it comes to moisture."
"Best Moisturizer EVER

Literally the best moisturizer I’ve ever used. Helps soothe my acne and moisturizes me without feeling heavy. Perfect for your hands as well. Couldn’t recommend this enough!"
"Skin Savior

this stuff literally saved my skin. I had horrible perioral dermatitis around my nose and this helped clear it up. no irritating fragrance and makes your skin look baby smooth."
"FAB for sure!

Hands down my favorite moisturizer!  Nothing sinks in as fast!  One star deducted because I received two tubs instead of tubes."
"Nice

It's smooth to apply, it doesn't make me oily. My skin has been feeling so soft! I don't love the price, but it's a good product."
"So far so good!

It helps my combo, sensitive skin. Mostly it’s been on the dry side. It really does what it says with hydration! It’s not too thick and heavy it feels light on the skin! I don’t feel like it clogs my pores either."
"Real Moisture

This product is great on my skin. I’ve been using it on my face and it has a nice cooling affect during application. It’s the only product that has really made my dry skin feel moisturized, especially during the winter months. My skin is sensitive and I haven’t noticed any breakouts since using this product."
"Wow

I have dry skin. But THIS SAVED ME. I’ve tried other moisturizers and they clogged my pores, but this does the trick of a heavy moisturizer while being light weight. Worth the price because it will last for a while. I wake up with baby skin every time."
"Always keep it in stock

This really does help with dry skin. I try other lotions and always come back to this one. Thicker cream. Not really a smell to it. Recommend putting it on while your skin is still kind of damp from your shower."
"Good, not great.

This was my first time using this product and overall, it is a nice moisturizer. I was looking for a daytime moisturizer that would help my skin during the cold and dry fall/winter months. I was hoping for a thicker texture with more intense hydration, but this does a nice job and is buildable. You only need a bit for standard coverage, which will make this product last for awhile. I’ve been using it daily for a month and haven’t even gotten 1/3 of the way through it. 
Overall, I’m happy with my purchase. There isn’t anything incredible about this product, but there isn’t anything bad about it either. I think I’ll try another moisturizer before I reorder this one."
"the best!

Holy grail moisturizer! Formula is whipped and lightweight, never greasy. Absolutely love that it’s clean, too!"
"great for sensitive skin!!

I’ve had moderate to severe eczema on my face for the past couple years and I have to say this face cream is the first thicker cream that doesn’t burn when I apply it. I’ve also noticed a difference in keeping my skin moist, as with my eczema it dries out very quickly."
"I first found this about two years ago

I’m glad I found it again! It feels great. I have eczema on may face and this is one thing that feels light and like it actually hold some moisture."
"so good!

This stuff is so thick. But it’s amazing. My skin feels amazing the next day. I have the worlds most sensitive skin and this doesn’t irritate it at all! Highly recommend!"
"GAME CHANGER!

THIS IS A GAME CHNGER! I have suffered with dry flaky skin on my face for years. Since starting this, I went the entire winter without a dry face! Super light weight yet effective!"
"Wonderful Mousterizer!

Always leaves my skin soft and hydrated! Soaks in and doesn't leave a film on my face."
"AMAZING

Please bring back the jumbo size!! I go through it so fast I love this stuff. I can’t go a day without it. My skin sucks this stuff right up"
"Definitely worth trying

It's working wonders for me. I was hesitant to use on my face bc it looks like more for body but it's been keeping my face hydrated without greasiness throughout the rough winter. I would say buy it and if you hate it then use on your feet or elbows."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! I’ve been struggling with dry skin and recently got this product and it works wonders! The formula is a little on the thicker side but it is deeply hydrating, 10/10!!"
"BUY BUY BUY!

I understand the hype now! This is such a
nice moisturizer because it is not too thick. There have been times where my moisturizer feels so disgusting that I feel like taking it off. That is not the case for this product. Definitely purchase if you have dry skin. The ingredients are also not here to mess around. BUY BUY BUY!!!!!"
"THIS!

This! This was so lightweight yet moisturizing the feeling is unreal. My combination skin reacted well to this product."
"Burning

I like the texture and the price per quantity but I feel like all of the first aid products giving me a burning sensation at first???"
"New HG Moisturizer

Ultra soothing, not irritating at all for my very dry very sensitive skin. I use this morning and night and absolutely love it."
"HG!

I decided to try this after a friend absolutely swore by it as the best ever. I was skeptical given the thick consistency (I have oily skin) and lower price for amount of product. But this stuff is amazing! So calming and soaks right in - doesnt leave an oily layer on my skin."
"TRY IT!!

This cream is amazing for sensitive skin! It glides on the skin so smoothly without feeling greasy or sticky. It’s lightweight and adds just enough moisture. Highly recommend!"
"GREAT MOISTURIZER

I have VERY oily skin around my t zone and when this absorbs it doesn’t feel like there’s pounds of product on my face. My face gets so dry in the winter it hurts, this makes it feel so much better"
"the best

This product is amazing. The texture is so unique and light considering how moisturizing it is. I have tried a few other creams but I always seem to come back to this one. My dry, acne prone skin loves it."
"Love it.

I have dry, sensitive skin and rosacea.  This leaves my skin hydrated without aggravating my rosacea.  I bought it mainly for that reason.  I didn’t expect it to treat it-just didn’t want it to aggravate it, so I’m happy.  I have other items I use to treat my rosace.  But this cream leaves me hydrated-not greasy.  I’m sold."
"YOU NEED THIS NOW

I love this cream!! It’s thick and gentle on my skin. My skin gets super dry and patchy during the winter so its really good for hydration."
"So so soft

Makes my skin so so soft.  Second time purchasing this item."
"Dry Flakey Skin Quenched!

My skin is dry, flakey, rough and this has been the only moisturizer to quench my face. You get so much product in the 6oz container it’s so worth it. It’s rich without being oily or heavy but if you have really oily skin might not be for you. Give it try! You can always return it."
"First Moisturizer I Can Trust

As someone who is trying to have a routine for the first time ever, this was godsend. My combination ski was thankful for it. It’s amazing as both a facial and a body moisturizer. Not heavy or with extremely fragrant. Perfect for me who is partly lazy."
"fab ultra repair cream

this product looks exactly like marsh mellow fluff . Not only is it super hydrating and moisturizing its also has s super fun consistency :)"
"GREAT! Leaves skin hydrated!bObsessed!

Love this cream. Feels great on my skin and I feel like it really seals in all the previous products I put before during my skincare routine. Honestly, I'd recommend this to anyone. Colloidal Oiatmeal is a great ingredient for the skin. A little goes a long way too!"
"Great for dry, sensitive skin & absorbs well!

❤️Love this lotion! I use it all over. I work outside and can't tolerate anything heavy or greasy feeling, so this was a perfect fit for me. Absorbed well by my skin & does a great job moisturizing, even with my sensitive, over 50, constantly exposed to the elements skin."
"Love it!

I am an avid Brazilian Bum Bum cream user but this stuff in amazing. Skin is silky smooth after using this cream. Only issue is it is a bit pricey. But it is a new staple for me."
"AMAZINGAMAZINGAMAZING

I’ve heard great things about this cream but never got myself to purchase it. NOW... I finally purchased it and I can easily say this is the absolute BEST face cream I have ever owned. There was a change in my face after the first use. It really does a great job and making your skin smooth, soft, and hydrated. And to top it off you can use it anywhere. I love it. I am obsessed.  Definitely in my top five favorite skin care products"
"A MUST Have

No redness no breakouts . I have normal to dry skin and thisssss issss amazing 🤩 but I do not recommend if u have oily skin . Best cream ever"
"Not The Best

I was not impressed with this. I have very dry skin and got it to use on my face, and it was just OKAY, but didn’t seem to do much for my dry patches. Nothing to cry home about. I wasn’t huge on the smell, but that’s something pretty easy to look past. What I REALLY didn’t like is that when rubbing it in, the moisturizer would pill up, like it was sort of separating or something if I rubbed it in for too long. Not a horrible product, but I don’t recommend it and I will not be purchasing it again."
"sensitive skin is tough to manage

It works really well for my sensitive skin, it's not perfect but it works good enough. I like that it doesn't have a fragrance and soaks in, but my skin is still dry after use so I mix in a little q10 or rosehip for some added moisture and that helps."
"will give you skin issues

If you have acne prone skin or don’t want to deal with breakouts stay away. I never really had issues with acne until using this product. It took me months to get my skin back to normal. Luckily I don’t scar easily. You can get better moisturizers that don’t break you out."
"makes me breakout

A little about my skin:
-combo/oily 
-acne prone

I have a jar of this as a backup for when I run out of my lineup of regular moisturizers- I bought it thinking it would help my dry patches in the winter and then got too lazy to return in. EVERY SINGLE TIME I USE IT, I BREAKOUT. 

My skincare consists of aha/bha 2-3 nights per week and vitamin c the other nights. I typically use the Inky List Peptide moisturizer, IT cosmetics Secret Sauce, or the Glow Recipe watermelon gel moisturizer (dependent on heat/humidity) and never breakout. But as soon as I use this on my face, WHAM! pimple. I’ll give this a 1 because it also doesn’t do much for moisturizing in the winter when my skin needs more hydration and moisture. It’s overpriced and not worth the hype."
"Wasn’t for me

I wanted to love it, but I just couldn’t. My skin isn’t extremely dry, nor is it oily in the slightest. CeraVe has been my holy grail for years and I just wanted to switch it up. However, anytime I would use this as moisturizer it would end up pilling off of my skin within 30 minutes. Whether I paired it with a primer and skin tint in order to do my makeup, or if I was just doing my skin care routine, it happened every time. If I had put it on before makeup, within that hour I would be having to get all of the pilled product off of my skin with a napkin. I tried so many different combos, stopped using certain products with it, etc. None worked! The only way it stopped was when I stopped using the moisturizer. The consistency of it is so nice and it makes your skin feel really good, I was just disappointed my skin didn’t love it as much as I wanted to."
"First review .. so disappointed

Why oh why oh why did this have to be reformulated to include essential oils? This product is no longer safe for my super sensitive, rosacea prone skin. I’ve been purchasing this product for over five years and now I have an entire tub of it I won’t be able to use because it’s no longer fragrance free. So disappointed. If you have rosacea or very sensitive skin, be cautious using this."
"Irritated my skin :/

I had been wanting to purchase this item for years, so when I did I was excited to try it. The first time I tried it I realized the cream gave my skin and almost burning sensation and my face would turn blotchy. I did however notice that it did leave my skin soft. This product is not for sensitive skin, but I did moisturize my skin."
"Wrong for dry skin

Not the products fault but this was recommended by one of Sephora's ""experts"" for me.  I told her I had VERY dry skin and my age.  She recommended this product - it's just the wrong product for my skin - it's actually somehow making my skin dryer and feeling parched.  I'll just go back to Oil of Olay at least my skin's not tight with their products."
"luxurious feel

One of the best creams I’ve ever used as far as feel. I put it on my hands after I’ve put on all of my lotions etc. post-shower. I do this because it feels so nice as a top coat. I don’t think it hydrated my skin all that much however, nor does it last for a super long time. I just use it for how incredibly good it feels on my hands. So smooth!"
"Careful if you have dry sensitive/eczema prone ski

I have combo/dry sensitive skin with occasional perioral dermatitis. I wanted something thicker than lotion so I tried this. After I wash my face, I use HA serum then this cream. If you don't have inflamed skin/open wounds on your face, this is a great moisturizer but since I have the condition around my mouth, this stings for several seconds. 
I ended up using this everywhere else on my face since I don't have that reaction elsewhere. Another thing is that I didn't find this as moisturizing alone and often find myself layering another layer of cream on top. 
If you have a skintype like mine, I'd suggest just using a cheaper moisturizing cream mixed with a couple drops of non-comedogenic hydrating oil. This is still a good product as it was more moisturizing than my previous lotion. I'd buy again when my eczema is tamed and my skin isn't as dry."
"not what I expected

Good consistency. Doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. But my god the pilling is HORRIBLE. You can’t layer this with anything. I hate that I can feel a layer of this sitting on top of my skin and it doesn’t actually moisturize as much as I thought it would given how thick it is. Returning this ASAP."
"Hate this

This is the worst cream I have ever used. It irritates my skin and doesn't provide any moisture even though it's very thick. I'll stick to Kiehls and Clinique."
"MEH

For a long time I remember wanting this moisturizer so bad and when I finally got it on sale for black Friday, I was ecstatic. Unfortunately, it wasn't as moisturizing as I thought it would be. In fact, I didn't like it as a body moisturizer either but I'll continue to use it Simply because I have it. although I know some people who love it and I know that FAB has other amazing products, I'll have to give this one a pass."
"A good option

A good moisturizer, maybe a littler bit basic for the price but the amount that you get is pretty good. May be too much for oily skin for all other skin types it should be good."
"Be careful acne prone skin

Bought bc I heard so many good things but made me breakout sooo bad- I haven’t broken out in years.. very hydrating but definitely not for acne prone skin."
"acne prone combo skin - love it

Using this for years (at least 5 years now) and love it. I have acne prone skin that’s oily/dry combination. I use this after washing my face in the morning and at night. It doesn’t feel greasy and I don’t have dry spots anymore. Love it!"
"Made face break out ALL OVER

I got this for my face bc my skin is SUPER dry. Unfortunately I cannot use it on my face. Although it IS very moisturizing, it made my entire face break out and I don’t even remember the last time that’s happened. 
   I will however continue to use it the rest of my skin, as it is very moisturizer"
"Intense Hydration? Where?

I tried really hard to like this, it’s just not hydrating at all my skin feels so dry after using. I use this in the morning before using a hydrating sunscreen that’s about it. Farmacy Halo Honey and Dewy Skin by Tatcha is soooo much better if you have combo skin!"
"DO NOT USE WHILE IN TREINOID TREATMENT

Definitely do not use while in tretinoid treatment it would make your face burn, over all a good moisturizer for face and body"
"Not working

I'm disappoint that this didn't work for me. I don't feel like my face is moisturized and gives that look of a moisturized face. But the number one problem that I have with this product is that it peels. I can't wear make-up or a lightweight sunscreen without it peel. Thankfully I just very recently bought it and willing be returning it for something else."
"not moisturizing

I bought this after seeing how popular it was and reading the reviews but it doesn’t work for me :( for some reason it doesn’t really moisturize my skin, or maybe it absorbs really quickly but like 10 minutes after applying, it feels like nothing really happened so I’ll apply it twice sometimes. It’s super lightweight and for reference I have normal skin that’s only slightly dry in the winter. Also there’s a weird minty smell."
"A must have in winter holy grail and saver

I use this product every winter this is probably 10 bottle.i wish i can give 1 million stars.My husand and my whole family use this product.It help alot during winter time."
"Basically an expensive version of cerave

Does it work? Yes. Really well, but it’s basically cerave. You might as well just save your money and buy cerave."
"A must have!

This is the perfect moisturizer for me. I love the way it makes my skin feel, and it has greatly helped restore my skin barrier. I’ve repurchased serval times, and the product always lasts me a while. Love it!"
"Great body cream

I used this cream a few times for my face but it didn’t work well with my other face treatments, it started to pill, but I love it as a body cream"
"super super good

I love this stuff so much, my skin was good but it was missing something and this repair cream makes my skin barrier very happy every night."
"life Saver!

I have struggled with finding skin care products that doesn’t take a layer of my skin off. Even the products my dermatologist gave me burned my skin. Almost like a sunburn and it would last for weeks. On top of having rosacea flare ups my skin looked terrible but I was terrified to try any new products. I finally pulled the trigger on this moisturizer. I pair this with the pure skin face cleanser and the ultra repair wild out hydrating toner and my skin has started to look amazing for the first time in my life. I have had less and less rosacea flare ups."
"Emollient

Does the job the on first application. I love to use this after swimming or in chaffing areas. I use it on my face a couple of times a month. living in the desert, this stuff is amazing."
"disappointed

I use retinol every other day and my skin has gotten a bit drier from it so I wanted to try this and even though it says it’s good for sensitive skin it still ended up burning my face so bad that I had to wash it off"
"Pills and Burns

This moisturizer isn’t anything special in my opinion but the cons to it is that it burns like really bad which has never happened to me before and it also pills which is strange. I thought it was my sunscreen or other products but I put it on by itself, and my face started pilling. I usually don’t do reviews but I think some people should know."
"burns!

I’ve used the ultra repair cream for over 6 years and they recently changed their formula and now it BURNS when I put it on. It doesnt even burn when I put my tretinoin on but the second I put this on, it burns!!"
"Love it

I'm surprised how much I love this. It's so cost effective and the product works great for me. I have normal skin and it's great for both night time and for day time layered with an spf. I will be reordering for sure."
"maybe not the best for sensitive skin…

i don’t understand why fab markets this as a repair cream. it’s a nicely hydrating moisturizer that isn’t thick or greasy and it gets the job done. but the inclusion of eucalyptus oil just ruins the whole moisturizer imo. i’ve been using this for a couple of days, the first time i tried it, it stung a bit around my nose & chin but i ignored it bc i was also exfoliating that night. today, my skin feels very sensitized and my products have started to sting so i’ve decided to stop using it :/ first aid beauty if by any chance you’re reading sephora reviews please remove the eucalyptus oil from this moisturizer it’s defeating the whole purpose of being a repairing cream!!!"
"No nonsense moisturizer

Been using this as a night time moisturizer, feels great on the skin, very nice ingredient list/formula, doesn’t smell, and doesn’t sweat out like most heavy moisturizers I have tried… and is significantly less expensive than most other brands of this quality, highly recommend! 
The only caveat is that it just isn’t very exciting. It does what I want it to do, which is moisturize & occlude, and the colloidal oatmeal seems to soften & heal blemish marks. But otherwise it’s just a plain moisturizer with no frills."
"Quality Face Cream

I am consistently happy with First Aid Beauty products. Good quality, does the job."
"Worth it!

I’ve never tried a higher end face cream. I’ve always used Cerave. Wow…this is so worth it. It feels luxurious. My skin feels hydrated. Absolutely no irritation. Will continue to repurchase."
"Burns and pills

I was excited when I found this because of the price for 6oz of product. Unfortunately it doesn’t work well for my skin. It burns when I put it on after my skincare routine and pills when I put on makeup. My other face moisturizers do not do this. It works fine as a moisturizer on my arms and hands so I just use it for that purpose."
"i think they reformulated

i’ve used this before about a year or so ago & i absolutely loved it, but it’s just but this again during the sale & it doesn’t feel the same, it feels so different. it does hydrate the skin which is good, but there’s like a very very small cooling sensation almost."
"Home and Away Kit NOT AS PICTURED

I bought the Home and Away kit because it showed squeeze tubes, however it arrived with two tubs. Even the travel size is a tub. I would not have purchased if I knew it was a tub instead of squeeze tubes. I much prefer squeeze tubes that do not require you to dig your hand in to get the product. It feels unsanitary and messy."
"misleading packaging

Unsure if this was a mistake on Sephora’s end or not but the product I received was not these two tubes but rather two pots. I love this moisturizer but I wanted to switch over to the tubes instead of the pots since there is less chance of contamination that way. I’ll probably end up scraping it into a travel tube so that I can still use the product but I definitely wish I knew this before purchasing."
"heavier moisturizer but I would pass

Maybe I’m using it wrong but it doesn’t work for me. It irritated my face and I didn’t feel different after a week of use. Won’t buy again"
"STAY AWAY

Ruined my skin!! I went from barely having any pimples/acne. To having them all over! I thought it was hormones. Went to so many doctors and received facial all for it to be this moisturizer."
"misleading photo, different packaging

I like this moisturizer a lot but the home and away kit doesn’t come in the containers pictured. Both home and travel size containers are the tubs that you have to put your hand in each time.  I definitely would not have purchased if I knew this was the packaging…… literally bought the home and away kit for the squeeze type packaging since it’s more sanitary"
"sad and full of acne

Really sad to say that it made me break like nothing ever has!! I’ve never felt so insecure :(
It took me a while to realize that the burning I was feeling was not good because my face usually burns a lot during the winter because of how dry it is. 20 days into use it the burning never stopped. That’s when I connected the dots to my recent abnormal breakout. 
I give it two stars because my worked wonders on my girlfriend face! She loves it and it is helping her dryness. :)"
"Crime against my face

This broke me out SO BADDDD. I rarely break out, the only time i get pimples are around my period on my chin. THIS MADE ME GET WHITE HEADS ALL OVER MY FACE. Nose, cheeks, forehead, chin, literally i have never had acne like this in my life. I returned and got the keihls one instead, hopefully thats better"
"burns and hurts

I was so excited to try this and literally the second I put it on my skin started burning and got red. I thought maybe my skin just needed to adjust to it so I left it on, it burned for hours. I really wanted to love this but after admitting defeat I scrubbed it off. Unfortunately my face still hurts hours after washing it off and I am praying I don't break out.  (Obvi I have learned now to wipe it off immediately)"
"BEST MOISTURIZER EVER!!!

I live in AZ where the weather is extremely dry. This is the only moisturizer I trust! It wears beautifully underneath makeup and works incredibly on its own. It is worth every single penny! Every few years, the value size will go on sale for $15 and I stock up! Literally, I bought 4 value size bottles last time it went on sale. I love this stuff and I can’t say enough good things about it."
"Love it

Received a sample but totaly loved it ! will buy full size!"
"Good for the price. Has silicones.

Used this for a couple years. Is a great moisturizer and very nourishing. Its also a great price and has ingredients good for the skin. However it has dimethicone which I try to avoid. Moisturizers without dimethicone or silicones are hard to find, so I used this when I could not afford or get a better one without silicones. I really suggest that First Aid Beauty make a version of this without silicones!!"
"My fav

This is my absolute favorite moisturizer. Definitely worth the purchase."
"Won’t Be Repurchasing

This product says Intense Hydration, but lacks in terms of that. I expected so much more. It also pills which is unfortunate. I ended up tossing it."
"best moisturizer

Sooo good and I love the 8 oz for $15 sale every Black Friday!"
"Favorite moisturizer!

I love this moisturizer. I’ve tried what feels like hundreds and this cream makes my skin feel amazing. Great price point, too!"
"Love it!

Best cream I have ever used! It stands true to its description!"
"pilling

This brand is one of my favorite as it has clean ingredients, but this cream pills on my skin. I had to have others try and they also experienced the pilling.  It is such an unfortunate that both Repair Cream and Night Cream pills extensively. Hope it gets resolved soon."
"formula change

This has been my ALL TIME FAVORITE moisturizer for years and years. Ive recommended this to multiple friends and they all fell in love with it too, especially those on accutane because it’s such a simple hydrating formula. HOWEVER they recently changed the formula and it isn’t the same. It’s not as thick and makes my face oily after just an hour, which I never had an issue with in the past. Why change a formula thats been a cult favorite forever? Very displeased, why fix something that’s not broken? I won’t be repurchasing unless they change it back to the original formula."
"best moisturizer!!

I love this product! It makes my skin so soft. My whole family uses this. I like this more than the tube!"
"Love this product but Sephora lost my package

Love this product in the value size but Sephora lost my package and now it's unavailable everywhere. HOW?! Obviously it's popular.... facepalm."
"Baby soft skin within a week!

LOVE IT!!! 
Bought at 50% off this Black Friday weekend. Using this for my face to replace CeraVe Moisturizing Cream in the tub (it was too thick), my routine otherwise stayed same.

Witch Hazel, TO Niacinamide, TO Hyaluronic, and THIS"
"not a good end result

feels great when applied, but every single time I’ve used it i breakout and I’m not particularly acne prone. sadness, same thing happens when applied to body & face"
"bring back the old formula!

This used to be my go to nighttime moisturizer until they changed the formula and added eucalyptus oil now it burns and irritates my sensitive skin. Eucalyptus is a no no for people like myself with rosacea. Bring back the old formula please!"
"might’ve worked on others but not my skin

May have worked for others but for me it was a no no , soon as I placed it on my face it burned I thought to myself maybe it’s suppose to burn but then it felt unlike other moisturizers I had used it felt like it was just there so I took it off & it felt so relieving bc I no longer burned once I washed off"
"Better than $$$ moisturizer

Absolutely love this moisturizer!! I use pharmaceutical grade skin care, and this moisturizer works better for me that my $$$ one from my Medspa! Very lightweight, very hydrating. I use on my face, neck and chest and have noticed great results with overall moisture and plumpness. Just purchased my second tub!!"
"Ooh ooh, that smell!

Ultra Repair Cream may have intense hydration as advertised but I just can't live with the intense lingering stink. I have studied various reviews to see if it has been mentioned before but alas, perhaps my sense of smell may be off but this product is one stink, stank, stunk for me!"
"changed original formula

Sad they changed the formula - with eucalyptus oil, no peptides, and moving beneficial ingredients to the bottom. But better than other creams at Sephora so I still recommend but it’s not for me anymore."
"why fragrance and why silicones? :(

this cream is 90% perfect but it has dimethicone, which always breaks me out, and the eucalyptus is super strong (and essential oils break your skin down over time). i love it so much that i used almost the WHOLE jar before i figured out what was giving me all these little pimples! it's a travesty lol. i gave the rest to my friend who likes silicons and girl she's all over it. i just wish i could join her!!! this cream is hella rich and good value considering it's a sephora product and it made me dry patches disappear and even helped my dark spots but sadly i can't keep using it until they have a silicon-free version :( (and frangrance-free would be great too!!)

but tbh w you ill prob go back to this eventually lol it's that good"
"Not for my skin

Purchased because it’s advertised as a sensitive skin product, but it ultimately ended up not being compatible with my skin. It’s unfortunate because it’s a product that seems to work really well for most people and comes at an extremely reasonable price point."
"New formula NOT for acne prone skin

I’ve been using this product for at least 5 years and have always loved it. Now that the formula has changed to include the colloidal oatmeal it has been absolutely destroying my skin. Have not had breakouts like this on years."
"So glad I found this.

Super hydrating cream. I'm a Healthcare worker and my hands have been in really bad condition with all the handwashing  and hand sanitizer usage. This has really helped me to repair my skin. I highly recommend this cream."
"Worst Cream - Ever!

I was so excited to try this out as an alternative to moisturizers with fragrance in them. My skin reacted - BADLY to this cream. Every time I would use it all of my pores would become extremely clogges and I started having breakouts everywhere. This lasted for a while until I was able to narrow down the culprit to this product. I have officially stopped using this cream for 5 days and my skin has already started to clear up and go back to normal. This stuff is now foot cream."
"Prices increased...

They went from an amazing 8oz tube for $34 and now they are at a higher price for only 6oz.  And now we can only spread around bacteria in a jar instead of have the tube they used to have.  Finding a different moisturizer now.  Hate the changes for their benefit."
"Favorite body moisturizer

My favorite moisturizer for all over my body, hands, feet, and my face if I’m extra dry. I was skeptical of cost at first but at first use I realized a little goes a long way! Already purchased my second order!"
"the best!

This is the most incredible cream. It’s not just a moisturizer, it’s so much more. I will always repurchase this product. I’ve recommended it to so many people!"
"Such a great mositurizer

I purchased this based on the reviews and I'm so glad I did! It was great during the winter. I might switch back to CeraVe Moisturizing Cream for the summer because this one is a bit thick."
"Only cream you'll ever need!

I love this stuff! This is the best cream I've ever used. Really. It's amazing for your face (any time of year: hot summers, cold/dry winters), and it's a great body cream. Not too heavy, not too light. It's the perfect balance."
"BROKE ME OUT

I used this on my face and I broke out bad & I usually have clear skin! I immediately stopped using it and it cleared up ! I won’t be using this on my face at all !"
"Avoid this brand: drying, breakouts, irritation

I have had a horrible experience with the kit that included this and their other awful products...avoid this brand which has a bunch of false claims and delivers on none! Opt for Strivectin, Peter Thomas Roth, and others where you’ll get what you pay for. Look at what YouTube has to say!"
"TOO MUCH

A little goes a long way but the smell is really heavy. Getting a headache from the smell."
