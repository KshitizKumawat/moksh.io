This is the one. Its on the heavier side, which I would normally shy away from, but this cream absorbs very well into my skin, leaving it feeling calm and soft. It has also never caused an acne flare up for me and instead seems to calm my skin. \nBefore using this product my face was a mess of volcanic acne eruptions, complete with dark acne scars. \"Skin care\" for me meant scrubbing my face a thousand times a day and using every face mask under the sun. I stopped all that thank goodness, and started to treat my skin gently. This has worked wayyy better than bouncing between products and trying new harsh scrubs every other week. I now treat my skin as if it is sensitive and have a true routine using just a few products.  This product is key to that, and I use it night and day and night to protect my skin and calm any redness and irritation. I would definitely recommend trying this product - even if you don't end up loving it for your face, its great to use on your hands (especially because I'm washing them so often now).

I also suffer from contact dermatitis so I am very paranoid about what can cause a reaction on my face. This moisturizer is great if you are trying to avoid any potential irritants. It also ranks pretty high on the Environmental Working Group's ingredients scan.  It feels so good to have a lotion for dry skin that is good at serving its purpose, no extra fluff and ingredients you don't need. I will say...if you suffer from dryness, you could find a thicker lotion than this, but I prefer to apply layers throughout the day than opt for something that can potentially irritate my skin. Since you can apply this anywhere, I take the extra and rub into my hands and elbows. It really does soothe my temporary irritations from the retinoid uglies.

I tend to not think of it until the change of seasons or winter when my skin is raw and flaky and in desperate need of help.  This is soothing and it makes skin look much better after a few days of use.  It also works awesome as a protectant in cold windy weather.  Today, however, I have been suffering from some odd and excruciating allergic reaction on my neck and upper chest.  It itches and burned so much that I could think of nothing else and became progressively worse as I couldn\u2019t resist touching and scratching.  I tried hydrocortisone, calamine and topical Benadryl but nothing made a bit of difference.  On a whim, I decided to try FAB Ultra Repair cream and figured it would at least moisturize the area.

{"id": 1081, "text": "MIRACLE CREAM\n\nI bought this because I was looking for something to get for my boyfriend since he has eczema and really dry skin. I ended up using it one morning when I was in a rush and OH MY GOODNESS it has CHANGED my skincare. \n\nFirst of all, I have been using coconut oil on my face for about five years and it has completely changed my skin in general. And by \u201cchanged\u201d I mean I went from having acne all over my cheeks and combination skin to now my skin is completely clear, and I get complemented on it all the time because of how it always has a natural glow. \n\nSo that helped, but this has saved it in a completely different way. I am very fair skinned and my skin is supersensitive. I burn easily, and a lot of products make my skin really red. \n\nThis product is phenomenal for helping any issue it may have. Sunburn? I put this on and within a day or two my skin is mostly back to normal (which is a miracle for me who is from Siberia). Need something easy to put under make up? This works perfectly, and actually I have noticed my make up stays on longer. Boyfriend has eczema and super dry skin? He absolutely loves this stuff and it has been a lifesaver for him as well. I even recently got a blister on my toe that hurt really really badly. I put this on and it helped heal the skin like Neosporin... except better.\n\nI now use it every day and I take it with me everywhere. I will even occasionally put it on my lips if they are feeling extra dry or extra burnt. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make your skin look super dewy or anything but for an every day moisturizer that you can use for literally anything it\u2019s absolutely phenomenal. It also plays really well with other products in my experience. \n\nDo yourself a favor and at least buy the 2oz version. It\u2019s only $12 and it really is worth every penny.

This cream is also terrible under my light makeup routine (only tinted moisturizer and concealer) and even flakes off.

{"id": 1323, "text": "Holy Grail Year-Round Night Cream\n\nUp until discovering FAB's Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration moisturizer, I veered straight away from any and all heavier creams in fear that they would make my oilier parts even oilier. On a whim last holiday season I decided to pick up a small jar of it just to use on my cheeks and neck which, especially as I've gotten a bit older, tend to get pretty dry during the winter months. For the first few weeks, I only used it on my dry areas in conjunction with a lighter moisturizer on my t-zone and noticed a massive difference in the feel and look of those areas. No more rough texture, no more small flakes, nothing. One day, just \"for science\", I decided to see what it would be like to try the cream on my entire face, oily spots included. \n\nI woke up the next morning absolutely amazed by how soft and oil-free my entire face was. Normally with my lightweight moisturizers, I'd wake up and my forehead and nose would already be shiny. I assumed that was just always going to be the case. As it turns out, my skin was actually overproducing oils to counteract how parched it was!\n\nI now use the FAB Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration all over my face every single night, even in the summer, and always wake up with baby soft skin. It does take a moment to soak in and I do look pretty greasy for a little while after applying it, which is obviously not a problem when I'm heading right to bed, but it is for that reason why I don't also wear it as my day cream. I'm sure that for those who have dry or combo-dry skin that wouldn't be as much of an issue though!\n\nHighly recommend for anyone who feels like they need an extra boost of moisture, regardless of skin type!", "Date": "26 December 2018", "Rating": "5 stars", "cats": [], "entities": [[99, 2708, "pos_Skin"], [393, 3002, "pos_Skin"], [1664, 4273, "pos_Skin"]], "Comments": []}

I bought this for that purpose and it softened, repaired, & calmed the redness within a few days if even. For an everyday moisturizer on oily skin like mine, it might be too heavy. Still hydrates and absorbs well. I don\u2019t write reviews but this definitely deserved one.

I don't know how to describe it or use the right word. If I glide my hand against the other, it's not smooth. I was expecting soft, supple skin but the ingredients are very heavy in this product so I should have known better.

The Coconut Water Cream is so much better and I'll stick to using that as my go-to face moisturizer. HOWEVER, the Ultra Repair Cream works great as a body/dry patch moisturizer!

It works better than most other \"body lotions\" without that greasy and sticky feeling.
