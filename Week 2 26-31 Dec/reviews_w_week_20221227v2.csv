2022-11-18,13_Nov_2022,Yes,No,No,,1 star,P4R1,Disastrous formula change.,"I've been using this FAB cream for almost a decade. I have spent thousands of dollars on just this one cream - I've got a whole family with sensitive skin and we live in an area with very harsh winters. We've bought uncounted tubes and tubs of this stuff (as well as now-discontinued fragrances, rip coconut lime). This used to be the absolute best cream you could buy for a variety of concerns - dry skin, acne, eczema, flakiness, EVERYTHING. The scent was pleasant and the texture, once it sunk in, left your skin actually soft but never greasy and weird. Holy Grail, totally deserving of every accolade it received. 

Welp. Over the last year that's almost all changed. The fragrance is more or less the same, but I suddenly noticed my hands and face weren't staying as nice as they used to. My family agrees: the cream isn't soothing eczema or flakiness anymore, nor helping prevent dryness. The texture is no longer thick and luscious but feels watery and insubstantial when applied. Once it's rubbed in, skin now seems mildly tacky, not soft or moisturized. Any sensation of moisture wears off quickly. 

I can't tell what they've done to the formula besides the addition of eucalyptus, but it is a catastrophic change. This product used to be five stars, now it's one. A pump bottle of any drugstore brand with oatmeal will serve you much better. I also want to note they have raised the price on the 8oz tube by TWELVE DOLLARS over the last six years - and I'd still be willing to pay if it wasn't worse than a drugstore product. But as it stands I'm heartbroken. Don't waste your money.",5,0,Electrobolt,"Brown eyes, Auburn hair, Fair skin tone, Combination skin",Over54,Redness,1

2022-11-17,13_Nov_2022,No,Yes,No,,4 stars,P4R3,"A must have for sensitive skin, till you react!","When I used the product for many months, I didn't have any issues and it did moisturize well. I even used it on my baby's skin and it helped. However, after a few months, it felt like I got sensitive to one of the ingredients (probably the eucalyptus) and got pimples on and off when using the product. Also, after a point I felt like it didn't leave me moisturized for a few hours later, just right after. I think it might be a hit or miss.",1,1,amrita28,"Brown eyes, Black hair, Medium skin tone, Dry skin",Over54,Dark Circles,1
2022-10-31,30_Oct_2022,No,No,No,,2 stars,P4R4,"Used to be great product 3+ years ago, not anymore","Let me start by saying I loved this product so much when I first started using it. My hands, especially during winter, tend to crack and bleed at the knuckles and cuticles especially. I finally caved and bought the ultra repair cream. It was amazing! The cream was thick, absorbing relatively quickly. It did cause a little burning at first because my hands were so dry and cracked. That subsided after 10 minutes max. I finally saw my skin looking normal and it did take away the small eczema-looking patch on my arm within a week. I was so amazed by this cream, I stocked up and would have anywhere from 5-10+ 14oz jars on hand at any given time and also bought this every year for Christmas for family and friends.

Then I started to noticed the formula was becoming thinner and not working as well as it used to. I noticed my skin going back to the way it was. 

Then the price got outrageous $78 for a 14oz jar? Seems a little excessive for how much cream I was having to use. Then it was getting harder and harder to get their TSV on time for Christmas. Or even at all,  I had it on autodelivery for the Christmas pear fragrance and waited 2 months after it was supposed to ship and kept getting the run around. I finally cancelled it because I got sick of waiting and I haven’t bought another product from them since. Then they stopped selling it! So I ended up going back to my old lotions that were less than 1/2 the price for more product.",34,4,TLC936,"Blue eyes, Red hair, Fair skin tone, Combination skin",Over54,Redness,1

2022-10-23,23_Oct_2022,No,Yes,No,,5 stars,P4R7,Worth it! Calms rosacea,"I have rosacea and super sensitive skin and I wanted a moisturizer I could use daily that wouldn’t aggravate my skin, but rather calm it down a bit. Enter this cream: at first, I didn’t think it did anything at all, but the more I used it, the smoother my skin got (less texture from the rosacea) and I saw a different in my redness on my face. As soon as you apply it to irritated and hot skin, it’s so cooling and feels so nice! I use it after Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and it feels great. Also, for the person who said that this is just a more expensive version of Cerave — I disagree. Not all moisturizers work for everyone — for some reason, Cerave doesn’t work well at all with my skin, but FAB ultra hydrating cream truly does soothe it. Worth the price for the tub because I’ve only used about 1/5th of it and I’ve been using it every day for about 3 months now!",14,1,vrave,"Brown eyes, Tan skin tone, Combination skin",Over54,Redness,1

It is intended for dry to very dry skin however I didn’t find it hydrating enough. I used it from september to march so basically winter and it wasn’t cut out for this weather. See its ingredients include oat, ceramides, niacinamide, and MANY silicones. The problem with this was that the cream left this residue which was clearly due to the silicones. It was very fast absorbing and I needed alot of product in order to feel moisturized. When I washed my face it felt like there was a layer of cream sitting there so I didn’t like that at all. Also, I think because of the niacinamide there was a BURNING sensation for many days when I first started using it but I got used to it eventually. I’ve never had a cream that lasted me such a short time. I think this cream would suit summers cuz it wasn’t enough for the winter here and summers here get very humid so it would literally just melt off cuz of the silicones. There were many times I outright hated how it made my skin feel so I don’t think I would use it again.",9,5,potatotots,"Brown eyes, Black hair, Deep skin tone, Combination skin",,Blackheads,1

I read some other reviews about the reformulation of this product and the addition of eucalyptus oil which irritates some sensitive skin, and I will say it's definitely in there and does smell like it could irritate severely sensitive skin. Mine did totally fine but I do see how it could irritate some skin. Overall though, I highly HIGHLY recommend giving this a try for dry, acne prone skin! It has changed everything for me and is helping my skin get to a much more comfortable and healing state. A super good price too for how big of a container it is!

First, I have come to develop mild eczema on my eyelids. Using a small amount around my eyelids has calmed some of the itching and cracking skin. Another redeeming quality is it’s longevity. I live in an aird climate and it’s very difficult to get moisturizer to stick around. This keeps my face soft and mostly hydrated throughout the day. It does a far better job than others I’ve tried (looking at you Tatcha and Drunk Elephant). Third, this is a great price for the quality of product. Especially with the value sets. 

I’m giving this four stars because this product seems to leave a (waxy-like? or silicone-like?) film over my face. I’m not sure how to describe it, but it feels like a residue of sorts. The initial texture is quite dreamy though. Also, I’m not a fan of the smell. Eucalyptus is okay, but it tends to smell kind of stale or perhaps  mildewy. Again, that might not be the correct word.

To begin with, I can say with certainty that this product really did improve the redness in my skin with continuous use, but the results are not instantaneous. It takes weeks of using the cream to see improvement but after going through a full tub I can say my cheeks and nose aren’t constantly red anymore which is what I was looking for. It also is an effective moisturizer that doesn’t leave my face looking or feeling greasy or shiny which is a plus for me.

Sometimes it does sting my skin, like other reviewers have mentioned, when I apply this but all the moisturizers and creams I have ever used have done this at one point or another. It also only stings my skin when I apply it after doing a more aggressive treatment or serum with acids so it could be that another product is senstizing my skin and then this on top just exacerbates it a little. It’s nothing that has made me concerned enough to discontinue use because of how infrequent it is and how it only happens when I’m using more “aggressive” treatments on my face for lack of a better term.

Overall, I really am dedicated to this moisturizer. It’s a good amount of product for the price and it really is a simple cream that’s effective at reducing redness. It won’t really do anything else for your skin, so I can see how this wouldn’t be for everyone but it really works for my dry and fairly sensitive skin.",8,4,PippyJ,"Blue eyes, Blonde hair, Fair skin tone, Dry skin",,Acne,1

I have very dry sensitive skin, to the point it gets flaky and red around my nose and mouth and forehead. I’ve always had horrible experiences buying any products because as soon as I apply it it feels like my face is on fire. What has worked for me is cocoa oil w vitamin e right after the shower and waiting 5 min for my skin to soak up the oil and then I apply a thick layer of aveeno eczema therapy and it works but not 100%. So I decided to give this new cream a try. The first day I was 100% shocked, my skin felt amazing, after so many years of feeling super dry skin the first and second day made my skin feel so soft, it looked hydrated without looking oily, it felt stretchy and It blew my mind. By the third day I started noticing irritation around my cheeks and nose. My skin started looking burnt, literally! Then when I applied the cream it started to burn. I stop using it at day 5 because my skin was getting worse within each day of use. So my conclusion is if I use this product it’s probably gonna have to be once a week or every other week only when I have to “repair “ any flaky skin or severe dryness. I think for people like me this product cannot be used every day or it’ll make the symptoms worsen. It’s an amazing cream but if you have sensitive skin I would recommend using it once a week or every other week.

I tried it consistently for a few days, to see if longer use would help – but unlike the product description mentions about immediate results, I didn't see the results I anticipated.

My skin is dry and prone to redness in the winter (frequent retinol use does not help.) And this cream just isn't very moisturizing. This absorbs fast as advertised, but once it does, my skin feels just as dry/red as it was before. Plus, the eucalyptus oil can be irritating to sensitive skin. I can't put this anywhere near my eyes. It's a weird ingredient to have in a product advertised for such.

I haven't any horrible reactions and don't hate anything about it, but if you are someone like me who is actually in need of ""intense hydration"" that lasts this really doesn't provide that. My redness is a result of rosacea, not eczema, so this hasn't done anything to soothe it.

I had overused my retinol gel because I stupidly didn't look into how to use it properly, and my skin, which is normally oily, became so parched and dehydrated that it was peeling.  My whole face became incredibly sensitive, so much so that my typical gel moisturizer was making my face sting.  The skin on my eyelids were red, irritated and peeling, and my undereyes could not even tolerate concealer.
This cream truly provides ""Intense Hydration"", but is also super lightweight and doesn't leave you feeling greasy.  The colloidal oatmeal really is soothing to my hypersensitivity.
After I purchased it (and had stopped using the retinol for 2 days), I applied a thick layer all over my face and continued to reapply every two hours.  It has been less than 24 hours and my skin is no longer stinging, my eyelids have stopped peeling and turning red, and my undereyes are plump.

After watching a bunch of Skincare by Hyram and researching something to help with my red patches (self-diagnosed PD), I went in for this cream + the eye cream with niacinamide. I have only been using these products since August 29th (nearly a month) and am seeing amazing results. My red patches are FINALLY GONE!

The package says ""ultra repair"" and ""intense hydration,"" which are both true but don't mistake that for a heavy cream...it's very light! A little goes a long way and doesn't feel heavy after I put on makeup (although I finally don't feel like I have to wear foundation!). I love the ingredients and they are cruelty free and claim to be vegan, although I haven't looked over the entire brand to verify that.

If you're still worried, try the smaller tube. But you can also use it on other dry skin. I use it every day on my face, elbows, and knees, so I like the bigger option.

I put this on in the morning and had LOW expectations because it felt like it just vanished on my face. It felt nice! But I thought it felt way to lightweight to do me any good and i figured I'd soon be reaching for my aquaphor again for some relief.

By nighttime, my skin just felt like..normal happy skin. I'm literally so amazed something that feels so light and non greasy was able to keep my skin SO happy all day long. By the end of the day I wasnt oily looking, I didnt feel dry. I just felt soft normal skin for the first time in months, and on my very first time using it!

2020-08-15,09_Aug_2020,No,Yes,No,,5 stars,P4R601,Great even if you have acne,"I have combination acne prone skin and was searching for a daily moisturizer that would help protect my skin and also not cause more pimples. This is the one. Its on the heavier side, which I would normally shy away from, but this cream absorbs very well into my skin, leaving it feeling calm and soft. It has also never caused an acne flare up for me and instead seems to calm my skin. 
Before using this product my face was a mess of volcanic acne eruptions, complete with dark acne scars. ""Skin care"" for me meant scrubbing my face a thousand times a day and using every face mask under the sun. I stopped all that thank goodness, and started to treat my skin gently. This has worked wayyy better than bouncing between products and trying new harsh scrubs every other week. I now treat my skin as if it is sensitive and have a true routine using just a few products.

I prefer the tube version because it just seems much cleaner to me. I have been using all types of skin care for 10+ years--always looking for the best one for my situation--and I always begrudgingly come back to this moisturizer. If  I'm reacting badly to a new product (i like to try new products that are considered ""clean"") like suddenly i develop fungal acne or my skin starts to look a bit dull or there are dry spots, etc. then i switch back to this moisturizer and my skin looks happy again. I am a huge believer in washing properly, moisturizing, and sunscreen and although genetics are big factor, please believe me when i say i feel like those things help too. [Be consistent!]

I have never used anything like it. I don’t have acne but I get a few breakouts before menstruating which I thought was normal/hormonal. That’s probably still true but I have not had a single breakout in months! I first tried this moisturizer as a free sample and I immediately noticed a change in the hydration, texture, and reduced redness of my skin. I then decided to purchase the 2oz and the results have been consistent. I’m now purchasing the value size! I use it everywhere—face, elbows, knees, butt. My favorite thing about this product is that it does NOT leave skin oily/greasy. Your skin just absorbs it immediately and will not look glossy midday. I have combination skin so finding a good hydrating moisturizer is realllyyy hard (especially one that doesn’t leave skin dry and/or oily in some areas). I can’t say the same thing about other FAB products but this one is PERFECTION. I have never said this about a product but this will definitely be a lifetime product for me!

I don’t feel like I need to layer another product on for more hydration like I usually do (was using laneige water cream for a year before I realized it was drying my skin more than hydrating it). And when I wake up my skin feels plumb and hydrated. 

- I have pcos so I wax my face every few weeks. I used to use tea tree salve and witch hazel after waxing but now I use this( after washing my face of course).

Also I've been trying to transition from my former holy grail moisturizer (the ole henriksen vitamin c gel creme), because that product contains a lot of citrus extracts/fragrance which can be very irritating to the skin.
First off, you get SO MUCH product for the price. There are moisturizers at sephora that are less than a THIRD of the size of this product for like the same price or way more. A little goes a long way, I use about a dime sized amount of product every morning and night on my face and neck. 
I love the fact that this product contains oat. It really calms my skin down and I see the redness in my skin diminish. Even though i have combo skin, it doesn't make me super oily. It's a thick cream but very lightweight once you rub it in. I also like that this product is clean and contains very good ingredients. Lastly, this brand is vegan AND cruelty free! I understand that they recently started selling their products in China, a country that can require animal testing by law. HOWEVER, PETA has confirmed that the brand is working with Chinese companies who do not use animal testing, so unless more information comes out, I personally do not have a problem with supporting this brand.",16,3,Caterina102,"Brown eyes, Auburn hair, Medium skin tone, Combination skin",,Acne,1

now that my skin is not damaged, i still use this just to get rid of the product (not the same jar / tube, but it has a great shelf life). i've realized that this product is actually great for my normal/combo skin. it moisturizes deeply without leaving a greasy / shiny look. and that same deeply nourished feeling (which might feel heavy for some) lasts ALL day - without making my skin look nor feel greasy. 

the amount you use is important along with how you use it. it locks in moisture very well - but you have to implement moisture (with a liquid product) first and then seal it with this product. i used to use a pea sized amount, which wasn't enough. now i use like, 3 peas of amount and that's PERFECT for my face and neck. it's a good, standard moisturizer that can fit well with all products.

This stuff has done the trick. After a month of use, the skin has softened and the redness is almost gone. It also does not dry up and peel like it used to.

I also suffer from contact dermatitis so I am very paranoid about what can cause a reaction on my face. This moisturizer is great if you are trying to avoid any potential irritants. It also ranks pretty high on the Environmental Working Group's ingredients scan.  It feels so good to have a lotion for dry skin that is good at serving its purpose, no extra fluff and ingredients you don't need. I will say...if you suffer from dryness, you could find a thicker lotion than this, but I prefer to apply layers throughout the day than opt for something that can potentially irritate my skin. Since you can apply this anywhere, I take the extra and rub into my hands and elbows. It really does soothe my temporary irritations from the retinoid uglies.

I got this as part of their 10 year anniversary little pouch which came with some cleansing pads and a primer I think. Didn’t use much of it coz I thought I’d save it for a trip coz of the travel size. 

I’m a surgeon and with all the hand washing and sanitizing my hands are always red and cracked and painful. This is my go to cream to help it heal. And I started it after I saw it’s effects on my husbands skin. 

How it all started is when my husband quit smoking, he went on those nicotine patches which gave him severe red burn marks. But he couldn’t go off them coz he was in his final two weeks of nicotine patches and this was a new brand that was giving him a severe reaction. So after the second night I put this on his red round patches and the next morning they were gone. The moment I put it on his skin just drank it all up. It was unbelievable. Now with the covid19 and both of us always excessively hand washing and sanitizing, our skin has been cracking and dry and super itchy. So this is our go to cream first thing in the morning and last thing at night. 

I wish it wasn’t this pricey but hey....... it gets the job done. I genuinely don’t know how people use this on their face unless their skin type is super dry or have eczema and such. This is an extremely healing but also extremely moisturizing cream. It’ll defo clog up my pores if I used it on my combination skin. All in all, my favourite body moisturizer ever.

I’m a total beauty addict and there isn’t much I haven’t tried in the way of skincare. This product really stands out! It has an amazing, thick texture, and a lovely scent. 
I use a lot of strong products on my face (containing AHA’s- like Lactic Acid & Glycolic Acid, BHA- Salicylic Acid, forms of Vitamin C- like Ascorbic Acid & THD Ascorbate, Retinoids, etc.), and this cream is the first I have used that actually soothes my skin. Anyone who uses acids on the regular knows it’s something you have to build your skin up to using, and even when your skin is used to it- irritation can occur. I was blown away when I put this cream on my face and it felt so soothing, and took away the redness! 
I can’t recommend this moisturizer enough to anyone who has sensitive skin, has a skin condition like eczema, or is like me and uses strong skincare products. Plus, it’s insanely moisturizing. That being said, it is not one of those moisturizers that you use and it instantly soaks right into the skin. This cream does actually feel like a cream, but I wouldn’t go as far to say that it feels greasy (I have combination skin and I don’t like anything greasy that feels like it clogs pores).

I hadn't used any FAB products before, and so having read up on what it's supposed to do I used it after a night of pretty intense skincare. My skin was a little mad from all the deep pore cleansing. 

I have sensitive, incredibly dry, volatile skin with eczema. And I mean I don't use ANY powder makeup on my skin (except shadows), and I am only allowed, as per my doctor, to use sensitive skin soaps and Cetaphil lotions.

I put this on my face and was wowed. The texture is whipped,creamy and luxurious and even putting it on my fingers, I was really impressed. My skin calmed /instantly/. It was thick and incredibly hydrating and I could immediately see why it was called an ultra repair cream. It was scent free, which I loved, and made my skin feel soft, dewy and refreshed. I'm blown away that this isn't even considered a 'night' cream, as those tend to be a bit thicker. I'm also blown away that you can use it all over your body!

It's a little expensive for me to be constantly using for any place other than my face, but I WILL be buying the full, value size. I feel like a bagel with the perfect amount of cream cheese.",18,0,AvoidingYou,"Brown eyes, Black hair, Ebony skin tone, Dry skin",,Dark Circles,1

The relief was instant upon application!   I put it on 8 hours ago and still no itching or burning.

2019-05-15,12_May_2019,No,Yes,No,,5 stars,P4R1081,MIRACLE CREAM,"I bought this because I was looking for something to get for my boyfriend since he has eczema and really dry skin. I ended up using it one morning when I was in a rush and OH MY GOODNESS it has CHANGED my skincare. 

First of all, I have been using coconut oil on my face for about five years and it has completely changed my skin in general. And by “changed” I mean I went from having acne all over my cheeks and combination skin to now my skin is completely clear, and I get complemented on it all the time because of how it always has a natural glow. 

So that helped, but this has saved it in a completely different way. I am very fair skinned and my skin is supersensitive. I burn easily, and a lot of products make my skin really red. 

This product is phenomenal for helping any issue it may have. Sunburn? I put this on and within a day or two my skin is mostly back to normal (which is a miracle for me who is from Siberia). Need something easy to put under make up? This works perfectly, and actually I have noticed my make up stays on longer. Boyfriend has eczema and super dry skin? He absolutely loves this stuff and it has been a lifesaver for him as well. I even recently got a blister on my toe that hurt really really badly. I put this on and it helped heal the skin like Neosporin... except better.

I now use it every day and I take it with me everywhere. I will even occasionally put it on my lips if they are feeling extra dry or extra burnt. 

It doesn’t make your skin look super dewy or anything but for an every day moisturizer that you can use for literally anything it’s absolutely phenomenal. It also plays really well with other products in my experience. 

Do yourself a favor and at least buy the 2oz version. It’s only $12 and it really is worth every penny. I would continue to buy this if it was $60 (though I  really happy it’s not).",0,0,IngaDanielle,"Hazel eyes, Brunette hair, Fair skin tone, Normal skin",,Acne,1

I have tried every way I can think of to use this on my well balanced, normal to dry skin but it pills and balls up every time. It doesn’t matter what order, what time of day, what part of my body, it pills and balls up every time. At first I’ll think, “ok, it’s soaking in!” But nope, give it 20 minutes and bits are falling off of my face, and if I rub my face, I can practically just rub it off with little greasy chunks of moisturizer falling all over. 
Of much lesser importance, I don’t like the smell. It would not prevent me from using it and I don’t mind fragrances in my cosmetics (I know that I should), but it’s too sweet and gags me just a bit.

On a whim last holiday season I decided to pick up a small jar of it just to use on my cheeks and neck which, especially as I've gotten a bit older, tend to get pretty dry during the winter months. For the first few weeks, I only used it on my dry areas in conjunction with a lighter moisturizer on my t-zone and noticed a massive difference in the feel and look of those areas. No more rough texture, no more small flakes, nothing. One day, just ""for science"", I decided to see what it would be like to try the cream on my entire face, oily spots included. 

I woke up the next morning absolutely amazed by how soft and oil-free my entire face was. Normally with my lightweight moisturizers, I'd wake up and my forehead and nose would already be shiny. I assumed that was just always going to be the case. As it turns out, my skin was actually overproducing oils to counteract how parched it was!

I now use the FAB Ultra Repair Cream Intense Hydration all over my face every single night, even in the summer, and always wake up with baby soft skin. It does take a moment to soak in and I do look pretty greasy for a little while after applying it, which is obviously not a problem when I'm heading right to bed, but it is for that reason why I don't also wear it as my day cream. I'm sure that for those who have dry or combo-dry skin that wouldn't be as much of an issue though!

I would usually go to the doctors to get a steroid cream that would get rid of it but you know, going to the doctors every few months when you didn't have insurance would be very pricey.  For months I've used Vaseline and over the counter Eczema cream, they would almost always burn my hand and make it leak. It was terrible but the only solution since I couldn't afford to go to the doctors. Now, I've been using this product since late last year in 2017, and I knew I took this photo back in January but I couldn't find it until now. 
My boyfriend's mother told me to try this cream and at first I thought it was just another lotion, it has no fragrance which I love and it just seemed normal BUT in a matter of 4 days, it helped so much. At night I would unconsciously scratch in my sleep, even with the Vaseline and cream but with this I can sleep well all night without it ever itching. This is the best alternative for my Eczema and I highly, HIGHLY recommend this product. I now carry multiple, some for carrying around and others for at home.

I used to have a very complicated skin care routine filled with oils and serums and scrubs for my oily skin. Once I committed to using this as my only moisturizer I saw a huge change. Now this is part of a two or three step skin care routine I do every day which is a big change from my previous seven/eight steps. There is no secret to this product, no special protein from the sea or water gathered from the purest cloud or something, it is just simple plain ingredients. If you don't like the pot they also sell it in a squeezy tube. As moisturizers go, this is really reasonably priced! The pot or tube lasts forever so the cost per use is brought down to pennies.

I used to have dry patches around my nose that made my makeup look horrible and flaky, no matter what primer or moisturizing foundation that I used. Ever since I started using this product, the dry patches have slowly gotten smaller to the point that I don’t even have them anymore. My makeup is now perfectly smooth and I even feel confident enough not to wear makeup on some days because of the state of my skin. 

At first, I was a little hesitant about the fact that I have to dip my fingers in the tub to get product, but I realized that due to the whipped consistency of the cream, it’s best if it’s packaged this way. I’ve tried the squeeze tube version at the store and realized that it’s difficult to get product out of it that way. Plus, you get to really use up every bit of product with the tub packaging. When I first started using it, I also wasn’t used to the heaviness of the product on my skin. I came from using Clinique’s Dramatically Different Gel Moisturizer to FAB’s Ultra Repair Cream and there was a huge difference in the consistency between the two. This product was thick and sticky at first, but it definitely moisturizes. It’s a really intense hydration, something that my very dry and flaky skin needed.

I was using a lot of these without makeup (except light eyebrows) to try and repair my skin and nothing really worked until this came along.

I’ve always struggled with flesh-colored bumps on my forehead. They didn’t have puss, it was just a bump. I asked for product recommendations multiple times regarding the bumps, and none of the products ever worked for me, it just made the problem worse. 

I walked to First Aid Beauty after an employee recommended the brand to me. I was going to get acne pads, but since they had the same packaging and I was in a hurry, I accidentally picked up this cream. I didn’t notice until I got home and I wasn’t up to going all the way back to return it. So, I decided to give this product a try. BEST DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE. This product cleared them after only a DAY of use. 

I have already been using this cream for a year and I swear by it. My face goes back to how it was when I don’t use this. Thank you, First Aid Beauty!

My particular problem areas are my chin and my lips. In particular, I had one horrible dry patch that just wouldn’t go away. That patch of skin was dry and flaky and caused my skin to overproduce oils in that area to compensate. These oils then caused bright red, painful, bits of acne to appear around my lips. I would use my strong acne cream on the acne, and it would work to get rid of them, but it made my dry patches worse. My makeup would go on patchy, I couldn’t color correct the area enough, and it affected how my red lipstick would look. It was a vicious cycle!

I was in need of a good moisturizer and fast before winter came. I did some research and stumbled upon this holy grail!

Within days, my dry, flaky patches of skin around my lips have gone away, and so has the acne in that area. My acne in general around my face has gone down because the dryness has decreased. My skin feel so much happier than it used to!

I enjoy the thick, whipped texture of this product and it absorbs fast into my skin. You don’t need a lot either! I’ve been using this product for a few months now every day and night, and I’ve only used a little under 1/4th of the jar. The scent is really pleasant and light, too. 

For application, I use a little dollop on each section of my face; forehead, right cheek, left cheek, chin, and nose if it is needed.

Let me preface this review by saying my skin gets dry AND oily easily. I use this before I head out every morning because my face gets quite dry after I wash it. It goes onto my skin nicely because of the cream's 'whipped' and light consistency. It doesn't absorb quickly, though- it'd feel sticky before it absorbs entirely. My skin is so soft and hydrated afterwards! However, by the end of the day, my skin gets super oily- so oily that I can see the grease if I touch my face!

I felt my skin didn't absorb it fast enough. But I figured out that you just need to rub on your skin a little more. Then it would be absorbed perfectly. It is not sticky at all and really light but would make your skin feel hydrated. I use it over my other serum. I feel like it adds hydration (I have dry skin). I especially like the 8 oz one because I don't need to touch the cream directly. I think it is helpful for keeping bacteria from growing. The price also makes me like it so much. 8 oz for 34 bucks!

2017-03-14,12_Mar_2017,No,No,No,,5 stars,P4R2265,Impressed,"To start off, I just want to give a reference on my skin type. I had oily/combo skin. I use to have one breakout here and there, especially during the summer and when Mother Nature calls; however, I would NEVER breakout, during the cold months and especially during winter. 
For the past several months, my skin has been breaking horribly! This is the WORST breakout situation I have ever had, and I know there are a few factors that come into play, but I do believe a part of it has to do with receiving so many samples from online purchases. I just started to use them all, just to see what would work well for my skin. That was a huge no no. I don't have sensitive skin either. Also, I was using the Ole Henriksen, the three little wonders set, and the foaming cleanser was okay at first. As time went on, it broke me out badly. On top of that, the invigorating night serum also broke me out horribly. At first, I thought my skin was just purging. My skin usually breaks out for about a week, with new products, and then it becomes completely clear. This wasn't the case.
Fast forward to now, and things are soooo much better. There were three brands left, that I had samples for, but I was hesitant to use them. I did, and the first two were amazing. The last one, which I am using now, is the First Aid Beauty. I do not like the cleanser. It broke me out; however, I absolutely LOVE their Ultra Repair Cream! I was worried at first, since this seems to be geared more toward dry skin, but it said it was good for sensitive skin. As I have stated already, I do not have sensitive skin, but I thought it would be gentle enough to use, since they advertise it for those with sensitive skin as well. I love this stuff! It doesn't break me out, and it dries down pretty quickly! A little goes a long way, and once it dries down, it actually feels like it dries down to a powder finish. My skin is smooth, and it really does live up to its claims. I would suggest anyone who is looking into this, then they should get a sample, if they are hesitant. Anyone else, who is ready to take the plunge and purchase it, then I double you will be disappointed. 
Personally, I am not sure if I would repurchase this specific product, since there are so many other moisturizers that I absolutely love; however, I love the serum from this line. Anything that is gel-like, my skin drinks it up and loves it. I have enough samples of this moisture to last me about two weeks. I hope this review helps, but as you can see, this product has received almost 5*s. That says A LOT!

Other reviews say it goes away but for me I can smell it 1 hour after application. It's got a slightly burning/tingling sensation but really not bad. I also feel like it just sits on top of my skin and is not absorbed. So when I apply this at night, my face does not feel moisturised the next morning. On the good note, this moisturiser is not sticky/tacky and a little goes a long way. But I passed it on to my husband because the smell really puts me off and doesn't do anything for me.

I have been a loyal customer of Kiehl's and I was using Ultra Facial Cream (and previously the lotion) for over a decade. During those years, I tried many other moisturizers, including various Aesop creams, Caudalie, Embryolisse Lait-Creme, and Josie Maran argan oil. They were other too dry relative to Kiehl's formula, or if they are moisturizing, my skin would soon breakout because the formula contains a lot of mineral oil.

I tried this FAB cream for fun, since I wanted something for suitable for winter and the product contains less funky chemicals compared to Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream and I LOVE THIS. 

It's slightly more moisturizing that Kiehl's. Not necessarily heavier/ thicker, but I think it stays moist well and this will be appreciated by those of you who use your moisturizer as a makeup base and don't use any primer. I feel that my skin is healthier too.",10,0,aurora26,Normal skin,25-34,,1

A tiny bit on the face does wonders to combat dry, flakey skin and makeup application goes on much smoother. Ut has never made me break out or anything like that. I've used this after spa-grade acid peels when my skin is VERY sensitive and flakey and it doesn't sting or iritate it. I also use this on feet, knees and elbows that can get rough. It's helpful during the summertime too- awesome for week-old sunburns when most of the pain has subsided and the skin is just peeling. But the thing that makes this a must have more me year-round is what it does for my hands. I have severe excema on my hands that itches like crazy, and even most of the medicated creams from my dermatoligist just seem to make it worse. This moisturizer is the only thing that doesn't make the itch worse and sooths the dryest, flakiest, grossest, most uncomfortable parts on my hands- even the parts that are cracked and weeping.

How bad could it be? So I put it on my shoulders daily for a week (until the sample ran out). I was FLOORED. No peeling whatsoever! My sunburn faded into a nice tan and my skin felt amazingly smooth.

After using this product nightly I have much less oily skin during the day and my flaky areas are nearly gone! This product is perfect for sensitive and acne-prone skin, as it didn't make me break out at all and was so luxurious and soothing after an exfoliative scrub. Additionally, my moderate-severe cystic acne has cleared up substantially (I would now classify it as mild-moderate) since adding this product to my skincare routine, which is probably an effect of having less oily skin overall.

No moisturizer I'd tried had even put a dent in the dryness, no matter how thick and creamy. My next stop was going to be a dermatologist, because I was at my wit's end.

Then I decided to try the Ultra Repair Cream. HOLY COW this stuff WORKS! I've been using it for four days and the dry patches are almost gone. I've been putting it on several times a day since I purchased it, with noticeable results. The redness is completely gone and the bumps and dry, cracked skin are disappearing. Needless to say, I'm impressed.

I've been using it on my neck and chest at night, in addition to treating the dryness on my collar bones, and I find I like it better than my normal night cream. It's very rich and creamy; it doesn't sink in well, but at night I really don't care. The smell is pleasant, too, which is a nice bonus. I have combination skin that tends more towards dry in the areas that aren't oily (cheeks, neck), so I was dubious that this stuff would work for me. I expected break-outs and got smooth, moisturized skin instead.

The Vi-Peels did their job at obliterating all the festering acne I had on my skin, but the ZO Medical products were SERIOUSLY drying my skin out. Their philosophy is basically ""no pain, no gain"" so I suffered through incredibly dry and painful skin for a few weeks before I went on a crazy moisturizer hunt because nothing was helping more than the first few minutes I applied any sort of product. 

Long story short, this moisturizer was the only thing that actually kept my skin hydrated all day. It has become a staple in my routine and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good moisturizer. It doesn't have a perfume-y smell and doesn't leave a greasy residue.

2016-06-04,29_May_2016,No,No,No,,5 stars,P4R2828,Ultra Repair Cream v Aquaphor for dry skin,"This is an unsolicited, objective testimonial as to why I recommend the Ultra Repair Cream over Aquaphor.

Note: I have dry skin on my face (particularly dry on the areas on the side below my side burn area and on my forehead - These areas also are sore most of the time with symptoms similar to a light sunburn [even when I have not been in the sun]. My doctor recommended Aquaphor and I have been using it irregularly for 2 or 3 years. Aquaphor has worked well, but Ultra Repair Cream is much better (see below).

Product benefits of Ultra Repair Cream vs Aquaphor (Empirical and subjective data)

 Ultra Repair Cream seems to soak into the skin quicker and gives a more instant hydration than Aquaphor.
 Ultra Repair Cream seems to give equal to or better hydration than Aquaphor, and lasts at least an equivalent amount of time.
 Ultra Repair Cream reduces the soreness of the skin area much more than Aquaphor. The difference is very noticeable. I would say that with Ultra Repair Cream there is almost no soreness whereas the Aquaphor reduces the soreness but it is always slightly sore.
 Ultra Repair Cream is not greasy, whereas Aquaphor leaves a greasy feeling on the skin which I have to wipe off. The Aquaphor soaks into the skin overnight, but the Ultra Repair Cream is not greasy from the start. When I use Aquaphor at night it causes the pillow to be soiled. I believe this is not so with Ultra Repair Cream, although I have not run a controlled experiment to test this conclustion.

When I was younger, I tried everything - prescription topical treatments, prescribed medications, proactiv, etc. etc. - My skin is so sensitive that if I used anything with salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxid, etc. for even a day or two, I started to peel like a snake and I hated it!!! I felt so self concious and quite honestly, sad. Throughout my life, I've tried many facial cleansers and facials lotions for oily skin. I always go back to my favorite facial cleanser called Purpose, which can be purchased at any drugstore. It's hypoallergenic and so gentle on my sensitive skin, plus it melts away all my makeup at the end of the day! It's my absolute favorite!! I always try new cleansers but come back to Purpose. Anyway, I find that most lotions or gels, even the ones that claim to be for oily skin, break me out and end up sitting on a shelf and eventually thrown in the trash. I bought FAB ultra repair three or four months ago and I'll admit after I used it once or twice, it did sit on the shelf for a month or so. About two months ago I decided to revisit FAB and started using it after I cleansed my face in the morning and at night. I swear, this is the most beautiful my skin has ever looked! My skin looks more even toned and brighter. And, I find that instead of breaking me out it actually prevents blemishes or if I do have a blemish pop up during the day, FAB seems to shrink my blemish  while I'm sleeping at night!

The next step is an injection therapy treatment, very expensive, not covered by insurance, with bad side effects. When you have a condition like psoriasis, you have to experiment with different creams, live a healthy life, and take matters into your own hands. There are many blogs with recommendations if you do a quick pinterest search! That's how i found this cream.

So I have a new development of dry, itchy, red skin on my arms. For the past 27 years I've fought with oily skin, meaning I've never used a lotion of my skin that wasn't sunscreen. My dryness developed as a side effect of Acutane. And I found myself needing a lotion that wouldn't bother my newly sensitive skin or give me acne while still moisturizing well enough that I don't need to apply more than twice daily. My husband picked up this product to help with his exema a while ago, and it helps (during summer), so I figured I'd give it a try. I love it.

I feel like it's quite lightweight but still hydrating enough to do what I need. I still have a little bit of a red rash, but honestly my dermatologist said he doubted anything buy a hydrocortisone cream would fix that. It has really minimized the redness, hydrated my skin, and helps manage the itch.

I love it so much I've bought my own 2 oz tube. If my skin stays this prone to dryness after the Acutane meds are done I'm going to buy a full sized tub.

My husband also loves this product, it really helps with his exema during the summer, when his skin isn't as bad. During the super dry winter months he needs something stronger.

It uses some natural ingredients such as oatmeal protein to keep skin hydrated. The texture is similar to that of Avene's but thicker. But I think it did not work as well as Avene. The good thing is, it is aroma free since I am looking after my 4 mon-old baby I do not want something too aromatic or with too many artificial scent.

There's nothing horrible I can say about this moisturizer. It is made for dry skin, but was just adequate for my skin (oily in the spring/summer, combination to oily in the fall/winter).

If i use this cream by itself, I find myself wanting to apply additional layers afterwards because the first layer absorbed so quickly.
Also, I wish this product, when included in gift sets, would always come in a tube..In fact, I wish they would do away with the tub all together. Dipping your fingers repeatedly into a tub of product is very un-hygenic, especially when using this just on your face.

My skin is like the Arabian Desert--it's dry all over, but with oily patches (they're still dry underneath the oil). I also get eczema and random scaly dry patches, so a product that is soothing and moisturizing is key for keeping everything in balance.

The Ultra Repair Cream is moisturizing enough for all my issues, but light enough to be used under makeup. It even cures the eczema I tend to get on my shins, and I've also used it as heel cream. I love being able to travel with this as an all-purpose moisturizer that actually helps my eczema and sensitive skin issues.

I started to use this all over my face at night and in the morning because I loved it so much and it's ""safe for sensitive skin"" right? Wrong. My face broke out into the worst nightmare I've ever experienced on my face, even before I took Accutane. For weeks, I was trying to identify the cause of the irritation and even doubled up on extra FAB products that a Sephora worker recommended but things seemed to be getting worse! I chalked it up to being from stress because I've had a lot of things going on lately in my life. Finally it hit me that maybe it was this moisturizer that I was using every single day and night (I'm a dummy for not realizing it sooner.) Upon checking the ingredients I realized that it contains eucalyptus oil which can be a major skin irritant. Obviously it doesn't work with my skin because after I stopped using it, things radically improved and my skin is even back to its supple, hydrated self!

These four things are the ones that stayed constant in my daily face routine. I'm not really sure which product worked for me or if it was a combination of all four. So I'm recommending trying them out!
Here's my routine:
-Moisturize with this product morning and evening
-Wash face with FAB red clay deep cleanser before moisturizing (kudos to you if you're using a clarisonic cleansing brush)

I haven't really used moisturizer before because my skin is pretty clear and problem-free. But wearing makeup does take its toll on your face.

I've seen tons of great reviews about this cream... but most were for other parts of the body. I was pretty skeptical about it for my face, but I decided to give it a try because I was in desperate need of a moisturizer.

This product is amazing. It completely changed how my foundation sat and looked on my face. The texture I thought that could be seen from miles away didn't seem as bad (unless you're right up in my face, then excuse you). It still looks like I'm wearing makeup, but it's not so obvious anymore that my foundation is catching on any dry patches.

It really is a repair cream. I have very dry skin and I have been getting a lot of acne lately. A doctor I saw put me on a Retinoid cream but the doctor I saw wasn't supposed to because I have such dry skin. The cream destroyed my skin and I have scars and really raw patches of skin on my face. I have been focusing on restoring my skin and the ultimate repair cream has been soooooo helpful. My skin is healing and becoming smooth again and I haven't had any major breakouts since I started using it.

Because of how thick it is I don't think I will wear this under make up. But this will definitely be my go to moisturizer for days when I don't want any make up and I'm focusing on skincare. I am also thinking of buying the big tube later because I am going to try this on my knees, hands, and elbows which also get very dry and crack.

If you have dry, sensitive, or acne prone skin I highly recommend you give this a try not only because it is a great product but it is also one of the more affordable products at Sephora and it is worth every penny!",1,0,4everacting,Dry skin,,,1

I use it morning and night (sometimes alternate this with argan oil as my nighttime moisturizer), and put a little extra on blemishes. I'm not saying it treats them, but it prevents them from scabbing, drying and flaking, which looks horrible under makeup. It's very hydrating and sinks in very quickly.

I'll just apply enough to form a semi-opaque layer all over my face in the morning and leave it on all day.

No matter how much water I drank, my skin was lack luster, I had dry patches on my elbows and my face was flakey. This was very odd for me. I always had combination skin on my face and while I lotioned my body daily, I never had a problem with dry patches or tone appearances. I tried the neutrogena moisture wrap and while it helped, I felt like it didn't absorb right and I started getting pimples on my back. I saw an add for this online and although pricey the reviews convinced me.

I am beyond happy I purchased this cream. It is light weight so it absorbs very easily. But it is also heavy duty in that my skin is not as dry. And these meds are giving me a serious dry skin problem. I use it on my face as well and have not broken out. I have sensitive skin. It doesn't take well to changes, but this has not upset it in the slightest.

I wish there was more in the tub. As with as dry as my skin in I might go through this quickly. I read that the lotion version of the cream was not as absorbent so I am reluctant to try it until I can test it.

But if you have dry skin, especially in patches, this is the product for you. Just a little on my hands and they are soft all day. My face feels smooth where as before it was getting rough by the middle of the day.",0,0,,,18-24,Acne,1

Ive had eczema in places all over my body my entire life and have used many cortisone creams/ointments and have discovered how much damage they can do with repeated use even though they seem to be the only thing that works. So even tho i know they thin your skin and cause broken capilaries i continued to use it on my face because 1.it did really work and didnt leave my face oily and 2.my doctor told me to use it. After seeing the effect it had after years of use i decided i was going to ween my face off of cortisone. And that was pretty much a nightmare. I tried so many different creams and so many products irritated my skin and made it worse. I searched reviews online for months and finally came across this wonderful gem of a product. Its gentle and unscented. Im not sure if its really for the face but i used it and it saved my life and skin! It rebuilds the moisture barrier in the skin and i learned that people with eczema need to do exactly that. This cream actually cured the eczema on my face and i no longer had it.....until i thought i could stop using it. Conclusion=use this cream for eczema and it will most likely take it away and never stop using it.....unless you want your eczema to return. I love it! Highly recommended!,1,0,jennnibaby,,,,1

It's not a terrible product but it's nothing special either. First of all the 6oz packaging is disappointing, jar packaging is just not sanitary. Your sticking your fingers in all the time and letting in light, debris, & oxygen. Not to mention that it will not keep the antioxidants stable, they will break down and become useless after a few uses. If they were to repackage the 6oz in a tube like the 2oz that would help. You could use an antioxidant rich serum before or after to combat the loss of antioxidants from the jar packaging but honestly you shouldn't have to. I have dry sensitive skin and after using this product the first time I immediately noticed irritation. After looking at the ingredients I'm pretty sure it's the Eucalyptus which is a known skin irritant. I have no idea why they put this in here because if you have any dry broken skin it will sting and it will irritate sensitive skin. Definitely not safe for sensitive skin. My final complaint is the overall waxy feel of this product which if you get in your eyebrows or is used by a man with facial hair will leave your hair crunchy and stuck in place. I did feel that this product moisturized my skin decently and absorbed quickly. It does feel somewhat lightweight compared to many other facial creams for dry skin.

This cream definitely isn't lightweight but I bought it knowing that it would basically over-moisturize if not just perfectly moisturize.

If you're looking into trying this out to see how it works with your skin for a week or so, get the smaller one first. I got the little tube in the Fab Faves to-go Kit.(ITEM 1417831)

If you get it and think it's too oily, just use it on your hands and cuticles! Or exchange it, obv.

I used about half of the big jar of this stuff before I realized THIS is what was making my face so red and irritated!

Apparently not- while all this might be hypochondria, for me aloe makes me redder. After one too many sales pitches touting their sensitive product that made me scummy and stingy. I'd given up on moisture products in disgust and switched to sweet almond oil.

I have been using this for a long time now. I went on accutane for 2 months, so I experienced how this product worked on my changing skin types.

Oily, acne prone skin (before Accutane): Before I started accutane I had very oily skin, but I had dry patches in the cold dry winter. For oily skin I would not recommend using this during the day as it might be a bit too heavy, but it's a perfect night cream. I would but it on at night and in the morning my skin would be very hydrated with no dry or flaky patches. I did not break out from this product.

VERY dry skin (on Accutane): Accutane made my skin very dry, and this product saved me. I used it at night and during the day. It kept my skin well moisturized and prevented the crazy dryness that comes with Accutane, since my skin was barely producing oil at this point.

Normal skin (post-Accutane): Now having stopped Accutane, my skin has become ""normal"" rather than the overly oily skin it used to be. I use FAB Ultra Repair cream as both a night and day face moisturizer. It's perfect for night time, and it absorbs quickly and does not make my skin oily so it's also good for the day. It's thick and dense, but still absorbs quickly.

In a nutshell: I would recommend this as everyone as a face night cream, but I would only recommend this as a daytime facial moisturizer for dry and normal skin types. For oily skin it might be a bit heavy.",8,0,NishaParker,Normal skin,,,1

The Ultra Repair Cream returned my dry patch to normal skin almost overnight! Now you can't even tell there used to be a dry patch. I use this cream after washing makeup off my face at night as a nighttime deep moisturizer and wake up with a fresh face. I also use this in the morning sparingly as a base for makeup and it hold up pretty well throughout the day.

What's even better about this cream is that it heals the dry skin on my hands, arms and legs. This is a use anywhere cream that moisturizes without feeling sticky at all.

What's best of all is that I used this cream on my boyfriend's psoriasis patches and it softens the dry skin so that there is less flaking and itchiness. Along with a no-tomato diet, this cream is very slowly but surely curing his psoriasis!

My only problem is that I wish this came in a larger tube. I have the small tubes everywhere, one on the bathroom counter and in my purses.

Review: This cream is instantly, I put it on my arms after I get my weekly microdermabrasion done (I use this handheld device called riiviva) and I put this on after my microdermabrasion and my skin is a bed red and it feels uncomfortable and this cream stops the itchiness and all the pain and leaves my skin white not red at all, it turns normal and I use it 2 times a day and I love it (I have my bumps but you can't notice and when ever i see redness I put this on and calm down because when I'm nervous or running all around the place and I am out of breath my keratosis pillars gets bad so I try to be calm and when I take a bath I put this on and I feel so happy about the results and this cream smells good (doesn't get rid of the bumps that is why I am using my microdermabrasion device but it definitely helps with soothing and i compared it to other creams for keratosis pillars and the other ones left my skin soft but not instantly and to my skin colour so for e.g my skin is with kp and stuff i put it on and it turns white. I LOVE F.A.B I just want to use it on my face as a daily moisturizer but I'm worried it might break me out as I need something for my kp on my cheeks and my acne on my forehead so Its so frustrating but I am thinking of getting benezylon peroxide and putting this on top and this will help fix my cheeks KP and keep my skin hydrated and soft on which ever area I put my anti acne cream. I am giving this 4 stars because It essentially does everything I want it to do I just wish it would help remove my bumps in total but I am so happy and il leave the challenge to my microdermabrasion but I am glad I found this.",1,0,KylieJenner,Combination skin,13-17,,1

I was getting beyond frustrated with my money quickly turning into a lotion graveyard under my sink.
With all that being said, I can honestly say that the day I bought this Ultra Repair Cream from FAB, is the day that my face stopped hating me (for now). It moisturizes without being greasy, (although on occasion, I do find myself having to put on 2 layers), and it doesn't have a nasty odor to it.

Luckily at the time of purchase one of the free samples was this same stuff, so I chose that sample. When my package arrived, instead of busting this open, I used the sample.

My skin is combination and I use a nightly drugstore moisturizer with a light formula, but sometimes my skin needs a bit more moisture. A little of this Ultra Repair Cream goes a long way! The sample was small and I used it all, which was a little bit of overkill. I used it all over my face and it instantly felt smoother and softer. The excess went to my hands and I also felt a change in them. I didn't get any breakouts from it and my skin still felt really soft for several days despite only using it once.

I was so impressed that I didn't open the container--I'm moving to China in less than two months, and I want to save this for when I get there.

- I love that it's natural.
- Light, non-greasy feel -- perfect for under makeup and at night.
- Reduces redness.
- Doesn't leave you shiny.
- Moisturizes all day (still not dry after 9-hour work day).
- Doesn't break me out.

- I don't mind the packaging, but it is fairly big -- not the easiest to bring when traveling I suppose.

I was miserable. All of my expensive beauty products would burn and I finally found a brand that did not cause irritation, but it did not really help the eczema either. Since eczema is essentially very dry skin, I wondered whywas it so difficult to find a moisturizer that would help? I was using prescription steroid ointment on my face as a last resort and I did not want to continue doing that.

I found this product online and I am SO HAPPY with the results! It has kept my eczema at bay for a full month. (I waited a month to write the review to make sure it was not a ""fluke"".) After washing, I start with the Ultra Repair Concentrate on my eczema spots. Then, I put the Ultra Repair Cream all over my face and the dry parts of my body which will get eczema if unattended. This does not ""cure"" the eczema, I had to get it under control first, but it has been EXCELLENT and preventing reoccurances! I would say that my eczema problem is about 85% better. I am a big fan of this line of products. I also use the radiance pads which exfoliate my sensitive skin without irritation.

Note that I have experienced a slight burning sensation when applying these products, but they did not result in any type of irritation and I have very sensitive skin. So don't be alarmed if you can ""feel it"" after you apply it.

2013-11-23,17_Nov_2013,No,No,No,,5 stars,P4R5005,Wow!,"I have been having some redness and very stubborn dry patches in my T-zone areas this past year or so and have tried a lot of things and not getting the results I was hoping for. Even a product I've been using that had a decent result, has not given me the same result as this product. My skin sometimes get raw and start to scale, especially when I apply any kind of makeup to cover the redness. I would use something to help gently peel the skin in the morning but by the evening I can see it'll start flaking or it will flake and if it doesn't, it goes a bit raw and tight, which is embarrassing and uncomfortable since this would occur during my work hours.
I got a sample of this in a freebie kit, hoping this would do something for me as I don't want to spend so much money on something that isn't going to work as I needed, and have used it just this morning and noticed a big difference in my skin by the end of the day! I made sure to keep working it into my skin until it absorbed enough and maybe added another tiny dollop to stubborn areas. From the morning's effect and using a little makeup (which in some ways makes my problem worse, at times), by the end of the day my skin didn't flake as much, at all. I'd say I saw a 50-70% improvement in flaking and 30-40% in redness! Since it was just the first use, the improvement I saw was enough to sell me on this. I still had some minor flaking, again as I had only used it once for the first time, but it wasn't so bad that I needed to hide in the bathroom to pick off the flaking skin. I had applied it again after work and my skin is more supple and the left over flakes are lessening to barely noticeable. This is amazing to me as the results are pretty noticeable on the first day.
I will say that some spots that are more ""raw"" did have a slight burning sensation when applying, but in a way I kind of expected that. At the end of the day when I applied more, I didn't feel as much burning, if at all. There's no scent that I've noted, so that's also good. I had applied some to my elbows as I've used a touch too much in the first use and they are very soft :) I still have almost half of the sample left, but I will surely be buying a larger size!

For the past 2years I've been experiencing extremely dry, itchy, bumpy skin on my legs that would not quit. Although I have never been diagnosed with eczema, I do believe I have similar to exact characteristics or it. I've tried nearly everything and anything that you can purchase at a local drug store, from moisturizers to anti itch cream. I've been to multiple dermatologists and have been prescribed steroid creams, those worked but once those tiny tubes ran out it was back to the same old shtick. So one day I did a massive search on the Internet for a product to fight the itch, I didn't care about the cost because I was at the point where I was so self conscious that I would do anything for this skin irritation to go away. I found this product and it seriously changed my life in a matter of 3days. I'm not lying when I say this, yes I noticed a difference in my skin in just a few days, it was soft, smooth and the itch was gone. The bumps had vanished and my skin even started to even out. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has any skin condition, whether it's eczema or not, this product will restore your skin back to health without the use of steroid creams or hash chemicals.

I actually bought the value pack which came with this full size repair cream, a facial moisturizer, lip balm, and a oatmeal mask. This cream has been used for my elbows and hands and also my face, and I will say it does a good job of putting hydration in to the skin without the oily/greasy feeling. I would of given it a 5 stars if this product was for my body, but since I have been using it for both I guess it didn't deserve the full five. The tub of this will probably last me decades since it is soo huge, and I only use at most a slight dab for my face.

I bought this product on a whim really to fulfill the free shipping req. and I always needed a good cream. The reviews looked decent and I thought it would be a fine last resort type of cream to use. I am prone to dry and tight skin after facial cleansing, and upon using other moisturizers I typically have to apply globs to relieve the skin dryness/tightness and if I use cream to alleviate the dryness, my face becomes very oily as the day progresses.

This cream is truly a miracle worker. It has the light texture of a light moisturizer but works heavy duty without the oiliness! I was not expecting this result at all and I am glad I was feeling impulsive. It does not even compare to the amount of money I paid for philosophy's hope in a jar, which still left me with dry irritable skin, and cliniques' so-called moisture intense cream-gel which was as effective as the philosophy product. Even just for the price, it is 100% worth it. It gave me no side effects and it feels more soothing and seems to have less chemical junk than other ""skin intensive"" creams I've seen.

It not only breaks out, but also becomes red, sensitive, and incredibly dry. Now not only does my skin have to deal with freezing temperatures and intense windchill, but I am a swimmer, and swimming is a winter sport. That means I am constantly in chlorine, which only adds to my problems. When I first tried this cream in a free sample a couple winters ago, I instantly fell in love. Any redness or sensitivity completely went away and in a couple days, the skin on my face was soft as a baby's bottom. I used to give little samples to the girls on my team because they would always ask me how I kept my skin so soft and everyone who tried it loved it just as much as I did. The best part? Well, I'm a bit of a cheapskate when it comes to things like this, I don't believe in having a separate moisturizer for night/day so when I saw the formulation and how thick it was (if regular face cream and vaseline had a baby...this would be it), I worried that I wouldn't be able to wear it under my makeup. I was totally wrong. Use just a little bit on your face in the morning and it will absorb into your skin without any thick or greasy feeling, your skin will be soft all day! At night, use a thicker layer so you wake up with beautiful skin in the morning :) I also believe that this product helped prevent my occasional breakouts. Oh, and definitely get the big one, it lasts me 3 months (and I use it religiously... not just on my face either; if ever my hands/feet/knees/elbows/basically anywhere else needs a little extra love, this will eliminate dryness overnight!) I picked my brain trying to think of one downside, and the only thing I came up with was that the scent takes some getting used to, it's not very strong; but it smells like soap&baby powder (believe me, you'll get used to it real fast when you see what it does for your skin).

Not really big on the smell of it when you initially put it on, but it's pretty light and fades fast so it's not a deal breaker. What it DOES do is hydrate very well. Even after washing your hands you can still feel it on - not like other products that disappear at the first touch of water. I've used it on my belly to hydrate my skin during my third pregnancy. I used coconut oil and cocoa butter for my first two pregnancies, but it was so greasy and ruined a lot of my clothes. With my third pregnancy I decided to use this and guess what? No stretchmarks (yes, it's true). My youngest son also has baby eczema and this has proven to be the winner. It really calms the skin and doesn't irritate it so he doesn't scratch.

The second strike was how greasy this product feels on my face. It doesn't sink into my face and it made my pores gigantic.

The third and final strike came when it began to mess with my makeup. I wear the KVD in Light 42 and after using this product, it turned it into this weird, oily powdery mess that I never had an issue with prior to using this product.

About 3 weeks ago I decided to make a face mask from a youtube video which included avocado, plain greek yogurt, and raw organic honey. I did it 2 days in a row and suffered a horrible reaction. My face was blotchy and red and I had a rash on my entire face. It wasn't very noticeable just by looking at my face, but the texture when you felt it was horrible. I made the mask because my skin was dry and made it impossible to be wear any kind of foundation without looking cakey. However, same with the rash - foundation looked cakey. The rash itself lasted a good 2 weeks.

A few days later I went to Sephora to find a good medium coverage foundation for really dry skin & the girl there also recommended this moisturizer. She said that her friend had gotten extremely dry skin from the wind/sun and this had been her savior. After feeling the texture and how moisturizing it was on my hand, I bought the tube for $12.

not wishing to continue tanning, my mother suggested first aid beauty ultra repair cream. she uses it for her hands and not for eczema. i reluctantly bought some and did not expect results in any way. i began to use it on my legs after every shower. not only did my eczema go away but, after 5 months of regular use, shows no signs of returning!

i also use it on my hands and arms during the dry winter months. it's nothing short of a miracle for me and i'm so relieved. it feels wonderful - no greasy feel - and absorbs quickly. the more i use it, the less product i need to use. i can't say this will work for others as it has for me, but i'll definitely continue to buy this, even if my eczema never returns.",0,0,hvg13,Oily skin,35-44,,1

Well that doesn't happen with this cream.

The other nice thing is that there is no overpowering scent, it's a clean scent, but not quite a fragrance.

My elbows and arms were so bad that I wore long sleeves even on the hottest days because it looked so bad. In my 40's it showed up on my face around my eyelid area. I tried numerous otc lotions and creams. I also tried several different prescription ones because they either didn't work at all or only worked for a short period of time. Eventually my elbows and arms got really bad (my skin was actually burning and sore) so it was time for me to try a new doctor. I knew of a well-renowned dermatologist who I paid to see out of pocket (he didn't accept my insurance plan). But I was desperate. He told me that I now had psoriasis. I wasn't happy but at least I understood why the eczema products weren't working. I was in Sephora shopping and decided to ask a consultant for her recommendations for their most emollient cream. I wasn't looking for a cure. I just wanted something to minimize the scaling since the prescription cream wasn't working great. She recommended the Ultra Repair Cream. Within 2-3 days the dry, parched looked was so much better. Within 3 weeks it was gone and I looked like I only had a bumpy rash. My skin was red and irritated looking but so much better than it had been. The dry, parched look was gone. After about 6-8 weeks I had nothing. I mean I am back to wearing short sleeve tops. I can't believe that after spending a gross amount of money during alot of years that an otc cream has given me back my life. I use it everyday now as a preventive measure. I would love to think that everyone can get the same results but I know that is not realistic. However, it you suffer from eczema or psoriasis give this a try.

I had an eye on this one for quite some time now and finally decided to pick it up. At a reasonable price point for the amount of product, I think there is definitely nothing wrong with trying. And yes, it does do my skin wonders, however not as expected. It gives a certain moistsure to your skin. However I prefer to use it during the day underneath my makeup as a base to make everything else last even longer. Does it give me the moisture I would need, No! Suprisingly enough, though it seems to do a good job with evenly distributing the product and releasing the otherwise tight skin from its dilemma, the moitsurizing effect doesn´t stay too long and I feel the need to put something more moisturizing on top.
I do believe however, the effects that this cream advertise do apply and are even applicable to the rest of your body, like elbows and other specially irritated areas, which is always a plus.

The result was the development of severe contact dermatitis which led to severely dry, itchy, scaly, inflamed skin. After hundreds of dollars in co-pays to the dermatologist for prescription creams, nothing worked. With much trepidation, I took the word of a Sephora employee that this had helped her friend who had a similar condition to mine.

The strong initial smell of eucalyptus had me worried that it would cause my super sensitive skin to have another flare-up sending me back to the emergency room. But it was actually very soothing. The smell always dissipated after a short while. My skin thirstily drank this product up. I LOVE that it absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn't leave a greasy feeling. It also did not break me out like other products had. It lasted a long time and is an excellent value for the money.

I did notice that once my skin completely healed, I noticed less results from this product. I'm have moved on to a different product to keep my skin moisturized.

2. Works great as a night cream on my face, doesn't cause breakouts, or oily skin. It's a little much for a day cream, and doesn't smell the greatest (it smells like a dermatologist WOULD recommend it haha), but it's been great at smoothing out rough dry patches along my jawline.

But I wanted to try the FAB exfoliating pads and it came in a pack with this and a cleanser so, why not? I decided to use it as body lotion.

First thing I noticed that my skin - even rough elbow skin - was super soft. I can' believe this is my skin type of soft. Then, I was ravaged by mosquitoes on a humid summer day. I'm particularly sensitive to mosquito bites, they swell to the size of walnuts and turn red and itchy and evil-looking. I resigned myself to it and went about my life. I took a shower and used this as body lotion. I woke up with healing mosquito bites. Not kidding or exaggerating. The swelling went down completely and after a second application so did all the redness. I'm assuming it had to do with the antioxidants or something? No clue, but I was in shocked.

I've since tried this on my face, and it didn't break me out at all. It works GREAT on chapped or peeling lips, sunburns, and healing acne wounds. I get some cystic acne that gets uglier as it begins to heal and this sped up the process a lot.

After I had a bad scrub used on my face my skin got really red and dry (really really dry, practically scabbing) and I actually just used Aquaphor to help subside it a bit.

Anyway, I still had some dry spots and did not want to use the Aquaphor when going out, and my other moisturizer (Clinique DDMG wasn't cutting it) so I applied some FAB all over my face and applied my makeup. Looked so nice and matte. But I probably wouldn't use it everyday since it causes me breakouts. Also, I used it on my chest when it got irritated and it really helped a lot.

I agree that the cream is super-emollient and non-greasy. And it's nice that it contains Colloidal Oatmeal and antioxidants, but I think there are lots of good creams and lotions out there that are just as good and less expensive.

The reason I won't be purchasing this cream is the smell.

BUT, here's the deal. This product has little to no scent, although it feels thick right out the jar, it goes on light and thin and it is soothing. When you look at the ingredient list on this product, it's no different than any other product out there but there is some kind of magic pixy dust in it because it works.

If you use it morning and night, it should last a good 3-4 months) and then I started buying the tube of moisturizer because I did not need to use it as often.

I would suggest applying the cream right after rinsing your face, and as the first layer.

Everything breaks me out. The word cream was very scary for my skin type. I am so glad I tried this. If you have dry skin patches, just load this on there at night. In the morning, you will have hydrated smooth skin. You need to use quite a bit on dry areas, but hardly need any on oilier areas.
I think a lot of people try this out for the body. It is great for almost any irritation. Common itches, rashes, wont sting eczema (my friend has it and she is the one who told me to try). I think it is okay on the body, if you are not dessert dry. If you are dessert dry, try it but use quite a bit. I like it for the body, but I prefer something a bit more thick for my elbows, feet, and hands. A actually use either foot or hand cream on all those areas.
I think the ultimate question is, would I buy this again? Yes. I actually intend on buying the large size after a month of using the smaller. I am not out of my smaller size, I just never want to be without it.",3,1,quesoluvr,"Fair skin tone, Oily skin",25-34,,1

I bought the tube however, because I don't like dipping my fingers into a tub. It's very unsanitary. And $12 for 2 ounces is pretty fantastic, and it will last you forever. I was using a very drying cleanser to treat my minor breakouts that I had (Peter Thomas Roth 2% Salicylic acid cleanser) which is amazing, but it really dried out my skin. This was the only moisturizer that brought my skin back to life. Try it! You won't be disappointed.",0,0,sarad267,"Medium skin tone, Combination skin",25-34,,1
2012-01-29,29_Jan_2012,No,No,No,,5 stars,P4R5974,Used on face in desparation and love it,"I regularly use Philosophy's Hope in a Jar for my usually normal/combination skin with great results and don't typically have an issue with dry skin on my face. For some reason this winter my nose and cheeks started to flake and look horrible. I went online to find a product for dry skin and stumbled upon all the reviews for FAB's Ultra Repair Cream. I had a tube of this already at home that I used on my hands only. My skin and eyes can be extremely sensitive (I have to use allergy drops in my eyes almost daily because they react to so many things) so I am always very hesitant to try new creams on my face, especially ones that can also be used on the body because those tend to be too harsh on my face. My flaking nose convinced me to give it a try and I am so happy that I did. Within one day my skin was back to normal with no weird reactions with either my skin or eyes! The cream does go on thicker than my regular cream, which is more of a whip, but quickly blends in to the skin. My skin sometimes feels tight after cleansing but this product soothes it and makes it feel like silk, plus I don't look oily in the morning. I still use my lighter Philosophy in the morning under my makeup but am considering trying it for then, too. Baby steps. Also, I obviously haven't used it during summer so I can't give a review for how it performs under makeup or in the summer heat but I can say that for winter night time use, it is absolutely perfect! As for the price, I am used to spending about $40 for 2 oz, was almost willing to pay lots more for something to help my suddenly dry skin, and this was only $12...a no brainer for me. I have now placed an order for the bigger size so it is even more of a bargain!!",0,1,Coolmomof2,"Light skin tone, Combination skin",35-44,,1
2012-01-29,29_Jan_2012,No,No,No,,5 stars,P4R5975,A must for everyone with sensitive skin.,"I have very few products that I cannot live without. I love beauty products, but most of them are just for fun. You need staples. Things that are multi-taskers. Things that are not just for fun, but actually work effectively and gently. This is one of those rare products. Works great on the face, especially if your skin is peeling and/or dry. Love it on dry skin, itchy skin, irritated skin on both face and body.

I came across this product because one day I was so itchy I did not know what to do with myself. I was not having an allergic reaction. My skin was just so dry I could not think straight. I bought this. Instant relief. I will never be without this, as long as it is available. Try it.

Do not expect much in the way of scent. It has none. I am glad it as no scent. That makes it perfect for irritated skin. If it had a fragrance, it would just irritate further. This may not be the cream for someone with normal skin or oily skin. Get a mini for the rare instance you have an issue. It is the best if you are sensitive, itchy, dry, peeling, skin conditions such as eczema. Just go for it, buy the big size. You will be glad you have it. You wont ever want to run out of it, just in case.",1,0,quesoluvr,"Fair skin tone, Oily skin",25-34,,1
2012-01-28,22_Jan_2012,No,No,No,,5 stars,P4R5976,"Pricey, but worth it!","I have never found a cream to match this quality.

The smell is ehh, but the results are perfect. My skin is soft and hydrated without that ""wet"" feeling I get form other moisturizers staying on top of my skin.

To try and save money I stopped using it for a week and a half, by the end of that time my husband actually told me to keep using the cream because it made my skin feel sooo amazing.

And at work I normally have to apply a hand cream several times a day at work, but with this stuff as long as I moisturize at home after my shower - I don't have to moisturize my hands at all.

All you have to do is apply it everyday until your skin is moisturized (for me about 3 days) then just apply every other day or every third day and your skin will stay balanced and hydrated.

I am very self-aware of it and have been to the best dermatologist in Wichita, KS many times and have been prescribed numerous medications and ointments. Nothing has worked. I do a weekly television show and had to wear make-up to cover it up. My wife and daughter would help me put it on, but I felt very embarrassed to even be wearing it as i'm a guy. I read about this stuff online and watched a YouTube video of a girl who just swore by it. I went out on the spot and bought it, and began that night to use it. You wouldn't believe the results!! You can hardly see the Rosacea at all. I may not have to even wear make-up again in front of the camera. I highly recommend this product for dry skin on the face, redness, or mild to moderate Rosacea. I will continue to use this product.
